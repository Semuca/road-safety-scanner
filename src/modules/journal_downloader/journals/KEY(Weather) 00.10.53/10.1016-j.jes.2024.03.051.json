Based on observed meteorological elements, photolysis rates (J-values) and pollutant concentrations, an automated J-values predicting system by machine learning (J-ML) has been developed to reproduce and predict the J-values of O1D, NO2, HONO, H2O2, HCHO, and NO3, which are the crucial values for the prediction of the atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) and secondary pollutant concentrations such as ozone (O3), secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The J-ML can self-select the optimal \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d without human interference. The evaluated results showed that the J-ML had a good performance to reproduce the J-values where most of the correlation (R) coefficients exceed 0.93 and the accuracy (P) values are in the range of 0.68-0.83, comparing with the J-values from observations and from the tropospheric ultraviolet and visible (TUV) radiation model in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shanghai. The hourly prediction was also well performed with R from 0.78 to 0.81 for next 3-days and from 0.69 to 0.71 for next 7-days, respectively. Compared with O3 concentrations by using J-values from the TUV model, an emission-driven observation-based model (e-OBM) by using the J-values from the J-ML showed a 4%-12% increase in R and 4%-30% decrease in ME, indicating that the J-ML could be used as an excellent supplement to traditional numerical models. The feature importance analysis concluded that the key influential parameter was the surface solar downwards radiation for all J-values, and the other dominant factors for all J-values were 2-m mean temperature, O3, total cloud cover, boundary layer height, relative humidity and surface pressure. Keywords J-values Automated prediction system Machine learning Short-term prediction O3 simulated improvement Introduction With the implementation of emission reduction measures in China, the major anthropogenic pollutants sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and primary particulate matter (PM) emissions have been significantly reduced from 2013 to 2020 (Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017a; Zheng et al., 2018, 2020). However, China still suffers from atmospheric complex pollution, mainly characterized by high concentrations of secondary pollutants (i.e., O3 and PM2.5), especially in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Sichuan Basin regions (SCB) (Ding et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2020; Lu et al., 2019). Additionally, the photolysis rates (J-values) are the crucial parameters that characterize the complex air pollution and serve as a hub for the interaction of various pollutants. Wu et al. (2020) also pointed out that the change of J-values can affect atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC), which subsequently impacts the formation of secondary aerosols. For example, the photolysis of O1D with water vapor is the major source of hydroxyl (OH) in the troposphere (Guicherit and Roemer, 2000). OH radicals, using to be an index representing the AOC, are the prominent driver of the photochemical reaction to accumulate secondary pollutants (e.g., O3 and secondary aerosols) in the daytime (Tan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022). Moreover, The NO2 photolysis, a vital reaction for O3 formation, produces triplet atomic oxygen that reacts with O2 to produce O3 (Flynn et al., 2010). From the above, the J-values are inextricably linked to secondary pollutant concentrations and AOC. In order to predict more accurately the secondary pollutant concentrations and AOC, it is essential to improve the computational accuracy of J-values. The J-values can be obtained from observational instruments and numerical models. Previous studies calculated observational J-values by measuring photochemical radiation flux, cross sections and quantum yields via spectrometers (Hofzumahaus et al., 1999; Kanaya et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2018) and filter radiometers (Crawford et al., 1999; Ruggaber et al., 1993; Su et al., 2018). Several studies have also employed the numerical models to compute the J-values, mainly involving 3-D chemical transport models (CTMs) and tropospheric ultraviolet and visible (TUV) radiation model (Ghosh and Sarkar, 2016; Tie et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2017b; Wild et al., 2000). However, since it is not easy to obtain data on cloud parameters, such as cloud level, cloud optical depth and droplet effective radius, the simulations of the TUV model are mostly conducted under clear-sky condition (Wang et al., 2017b; Zhao et al., 2021). Lantz et al. (1996) found the J(NO2) simulated with the TUV model underpredicted the measurements by 35%-45%. Kim et al. (2007) showed the measurement derived daily maximum of J(NO2) was 17.9% less than the simulation of the TUV model, and J(O1D) was 30.4% on the clear days. Walker et al. (2022) also pointed out the substantial bias of J(NO2) between measurement and TUV model simulation, which was approximately 45% on average. Although CTMs are the main method for J-values and predicting air pollution which contain detailed cloud algorithms (Pincus et al., 2003; Tie et al., 2005), their predicted performance is subject to biases in the initial and boundary conditions, parameterization schemes of physical and chemical processes along with uncertainty in the emission inventory, leading to increasing errors and uncertainties for the results over time (Mo et al., 2021; Ritter et al., 2013). The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and learning algorithms has led to the adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to overcome the nonlinearity between input variables and air pollution in the real atmosphere. These models can predict the pollutant concentrations by learning from a significant amount of observed data. Compared the performance of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Shams et al. (2021) suggested that MLP could be applied to improve the prediction of air pollution. Other advanced nonlinear ML methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), are also used to forecast air pollutant concentration in various situations (Alimissis et al., 2018; Fallahi et al., 2018; García Nieto et al., 2013; Rubal and Kumar, 2018). A robust LightGBM developed by Zhong et al. (2021) has a satisfactory capacity to predict PM2.5 concentration on different timescale (i.e., hourly, monthly and annual). An ensemble learning model, based on ML (i.e., SVR, Support Vector Regression) and DL (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory) methods, is proposed to predict PM2.5 concentration and its performance is better than the existing models (i.e., CTMs and other hybrid learning models) (Chang et al., 2020). Although the previously mentioned models perform well in predicting single or dual pollutant concentration, they are not effective in different regions or with different pollutants because the selection and construction of hybrid models rely too heavily on human experience. Ke et al. (2022) and Zheng et al. (2023) developed distinct automated systems including the optimization of hyperparameters and the selection of the best performance model, to investigate daily concentration of air pollutants. However, the previous studies of the automated systems were focused on the daily change of air pollutants. In summary, an automated system based on the ML models is a novel and meaningful approach, but there is a scarcity of previous studies using AI technology to investigate the hourly important parameters (J-values) for photochemical reactions of the secondary air pollutants. In this study, an automated forecasting system based on machine learning is adopted for hourly prediction of J-values (Ke et al., 2022), including J(O1D), J(NO2), J(HONO), J(H2O2), J(HCHO_R), J(HCHO_M), J(NO3_M) and J(NO3_R). The hourly prediction of the next 3-days and 7-days is presented to illustrate the excellent performance of the J-ML in the four typical cities. Meanwhile, the comparison of J-values simulation between the TUV model and the J-ML is conducted. The J-ML is also coupled to an emission-based observation model (e-OBM), replacing the original TUV model that calculated J-values, to demonstrate the J-ML applicability in a numerical model. Finally, the input feature importance of J-values is analyzed to identify the primary meteorological elements in different cities. 1 Materials and methods The automated forecasting system was developed and firstly proposed by Ke et al. (2022) to forecast daily concentrations of six common pollutants. In this study, the automated forecasting system is applied to predict J-values in the hourly time-scale. Its core superiority is to intelligently search the best \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d driven only by a data set without human intervention. The framework of the J-ML constitutes three main parts in this research: (1) the knowledge base, (2) the data processing and (3) the master system (Fig. 1 ). Since meteorological backgrounds and pollution situations differ from regions in China, four representative megacities (Appendix A Fig. S1), i.e., Beijing (BJ), Guangzhou (GZ), Shanghai (SH) and Chengdu (CD), representing the BTH, PRD, YRD and SCB regions, respectively, are selected to present the performance of the J-ML in this research. 1.1 The knowledge base and data preprocessing The knowledge base of the J-ML contains J-values observed data, meteorological observed data, the air quality observed data and model reanalysis data. These input parameters in knowledge base are considered from different physicochemical processes affecting J-values. All variables of the knowledge base used in this research are briefly presented in Table 1 . The observed J-values data, including J(O1D), J(NO2), J(HONO), J(H2O2), J(HCHO_R), J(HCHO_M), J(NO3_M) and J(NO3_R), are measured and quality controlled with the spectrometers in the monitoring stations of four typical cities (Liu et al., 2019; Song et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). More details about the spectrometer measurement are available in the research conducted by Hofzumahaus et al. (1999). The meteorological observed variables, including hourly surface pressure (PRS), 2-m mean temperature (T_Mean), 2-m maximum temperature (T_Max), 2-m minimum temperature (T_Min), relative humidity (RH), precipitation (PRE), 10-m wind speed and wind direction, are obtained from the National Meteorological Information Center of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA, http://data.cma.cn). The 10-m horizontal wind speed and wind direction are converted to u and v components of horizontal wind (i.e., U_wind, V_wind). The hourly parameters of air quality observation, i.e., CO, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, AQI, widely used in environmental studies are taken from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC, http://www.cnemc.cn). In addition, surface solar radiation downwards (SSRD), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and total cloud cover (TCC) are acquired in the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5, https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. The periodic parameter, i.e., the number of hours from 0 to 23, are also used to reflect the impact of hourly atmospheric variation on the J-values. The location of the observational stations is summarized in Appendix A Fig. S2. Therefore, to find the best \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d, the J-ML is driven by the nineteen input features in this study. In the part of data preprocessing, all types of data are merged based on the datetime. Due to the time period of J-values observed data collected from these cities is not consistent, the datetime of training and test sets are divided as shown in Appendix A Table S1, with a ratio of approximately 0.7:0.3. The missing values are removed but the extreme values in the data are retained, which can have a better performance to capture the extreme values in the real condition. All the data are normalized to [−1, 1] to accelerate the convergence and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. 1.2 Master system for J-values 1.2.1 Hyperparameters optimization Five common regression models are selected in the J-ML, namely MLR, MLP, RF, GBDT, and SVR, which enables the choice of different machine learning sub-models according to different application situations. Bayesian Optimization (BO), an optimization technique that searches for the minimum of a target function based on the Bayes Theorem (Feurer and Hutter, 2019), is adopted to automatically select the best hyperparameters for each regression model. BO aims to address the hyperparameter optimization problem for the complicated target function of ML models. The calculation of BO is more efficient than random search (Turner et al., 2021), due to its Surrogate Function, which is Bayesian approximation of the target function (Feurer and Hutter, 2019). After obtaining the loss from the Surrogate Function, the Acquisition Function then proposes the next hyperparameter set from the search space. It can use the information learned from the Surrogate Function to find a better hyperparameter set for each ML model. The procedure of the BO is showed as follows: 1. Choose the hyperparameter set by optimizing the Acquisition Function. 2. Validate the performance of ML model with the chosen hyperparameter set using the target function (5-fold cross-validation for each ML model). 3. According to the inputs and outputs from the target function, update the Surrogate Function. 4. Stop if the score of the targe function is minimum otherwise go back the step 1. The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) algorithm is utilized for the Surrogate Function and expected improvement (EI) function is adopted for the Acquisition Function. More details of BO can be found in previous studies (Feurer and Hutter, 2019; Turner et al., 2021). The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) cuts the training set into five roughly equal and disjoint parts, four of which are used for training and one for validation (Ke et al., 2022). The CV process is repeated five times to take their average as the final score for a hyperparameter set. Thus, the BO can help automatically search a proper hyperparameter set for all models of the J-ML. The key hyperparameters of five sub-models ultimately chosen are presented in Appendix A Table S2-S9, such as the number of layers and hidden neurons in MLP, kernel type, kernel coefficient (gamma), and regularization parameter (c) in SVR, n_estimators and max_depth in RF and GBDT. 1.2.2 Automated selection of the best model After establishing the trained models with the best hyperparameters, the J-ML will make prediction using the test set, and the performances of the five sub-models are evaluated by comparing observed and predicted values. In addition, the ensemble models are set up by Stacked Generalization (SG) method to improve robustness over a single model (Wolpert, 1992). In this study, the base-models are random integration of the five sub-models and the meta-model is SVR model or Ridge linear model, resulting in fifty-two SG models. Other models have not been chosen as the meta-model, mainly considering the actual forecasting performance and the time required for the J-ML iteration. Lastly, to automatically select the best model, six statistical indicators, including mean bias (MB), mean error (ME), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), accuracy (P), and index of agreement (IOA), are used to define a comprehensive index ( C I t o t , j ) (Ke et al., 2022). The formulas of the six statistical indicators and the C I t o t , j are presented in Appendix A Supplementary data. The C I t o t , j combines the results of each statistical indicator representing different aspects of the model evaluation. By comparing the C I t o t , j of all models, the best model can be determined. Therefore, the whole process of finding the best \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d is intelligent and automated without human intervention, which is the core advantage of the automated forecasting system. 1.2.3 Feature importance To enhance the interpretability of the results in the automated system, the Shapley Additive Interpretation (SHAP) model, a post-interpretation model with desirable properties (local accuracy, consistency and missingness), is also integrated in the J-ML (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). SHAP model can interpret the output of the model as the sum of the contributions of each input feature (Lundberg et al., 2020). Thus, it is used to quantify the impacts of the input features and analyze the importance of different features for J-values. 1.3 Tropospheric ultraviolet and visible radiation (TUV) model The TUV model of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is mainly constrained by these key parameters of the target city, such as longitude, latitude, O3 column concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA), angstrom exponent (AE), etc. These parameters are obtained from the satellite data, i.e., the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this study, the TUV model is used to simulate the hourly J-values for the same time period as the test set (Appendix A Table S1). The results of the TUV model and the J-ML are comparative evaluated to illustrate the J-values performance of the J-ML. 1.4 An emission-driven observation-based box model (e-OBM) An emission-driven observation-based box model (Pan et al., 2023), driven by J-values simulated by TUV model and Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) (Zheng et al., 2018), along with observed meteorological elements including temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure and planetary boundary layer height, is a complementary model of CTMs (e.g., GEOS-Chem, WRF-CMAQ and WRF-CUACE). The local photochemical processes can be simulated by the e-OBM based on the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism version 2 and the renewed isoprene mechanism to analyze the diurnal variations of O3 and radicals (Goliff et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2017). In this study, the photolysis module of the e-OBM, i.e., the TUV model, is replaced by the J-ML, and the O3 pollution episodes simulated by the e-OBM coupled with the J-ML are compared with the simulation of the original e-OBM to illustrate the simulated improvement of O3 via the J-ML. 2 Results and discussions 2.1 Validation of the J-ML In this part, the input features are the periodic parameter (i.e., the number of hours), meteorological and pollutants variables. The observed J-values are as the dependent variables influenced by the input features in the J-ML. Firstly, the RMSE performance of the training and validation set are presented in Table 2 . Overall, the best models with the optimal parameters selected by the J-ML basically have small differences between the validation and training sets, which suggests that all models can be well fitted. As shown in Appendix A Table S10, the best model selected by the J-ML and the evaluated performance with test set in the four central cities are listed. It can be clearly seen that the best model selected from the sub-models and SG models in the J-ML varies due to the difference in J-values and cities. For example, the best model of Guangzhou is GBDT model, while Shanghai is the RF model, which may be due to the more accurate prediction in a large dataset. The best model for J-values in Beijing is MLP, except for J(H2O2), J(NO3_M) and J(NO3_R), which are best modelled as SVR and RF. In Chengdu, the SVR was most frequently chosen as the best model. Overall, in the four city cases, RF was selected most frequently, followed by SVR. It can be indicated that these models are capable of effectively handling non-linear data and have superior performance for J-values prediction. The scattering plots comparing the observed and simulated J-values are shown in Fig. 2 . The J-ML performance for simulating the hourly J-values is satisfactory in all cities, where most of the R values exceed 0.93. It can be also found in Fig. 2 and Appendix A Table S10 that the P values are in the range of 0.68-0.83 and the IOA values are above 0.94, implying the excellent agreement between the observation and prediction of J-values. The small ME and RMSE values for J-values in four central cities indicate that the J-values predicted by the J-ML have small deviation from the observed values. It is noted that some predicted values are close to zero but the observed values are not, or some observed values are close to zero but the simulated values are not. The results of overestimation or underestimation may be attributed to the shortcoming of the automated system in capturing the extreme J-values at night time (19:00\u201305:00 BJT) due to the insufficient sample size to adequately learn the real variation of the extreme J-values. In addition, the best models selected by the J-ML in different cases are also evaluated and compared with the five sub-models and the TUV model to further illustrate the superiority of the J-ML. The six statistical indicators for the five sub-models, the TUV model and the best performing model from the J-ML are shown in Appendix A Table S11-S12. It is not difficult to know that the best performing models have a better performance with smaller ME, MB, RMSE and larger P, R, IOA than the sub-models and the TUV model driven by the satellite observed data. Photochemical reactions are more active during the daytime (06:00\u201318:00 BJT), so that air pollution can be formed rapidly under the conditions conducive to the accumulation of pollutant concentrations. Thus, the evaluated comparison of the whole day (24 hr) and daytime between TUV model and the best model also shown in Fig. 3 . Not only for the whole day but also during the daytime, the best performing models of all cities outperform the TUV model in terms of R and ME values. For instance, in Chengdu, the whole day R and ME values of J(O1D) simulated by TUV model are 0.81 and 4.69 × 10-6 s-1 as well as the daytime are 0.70 and 8.60 × 10-6 s-1, respectively, showing a less performance than the J-ML, with the whole day R and ME values of J(O1D) of 0.93 and 1.69 × 10-6 s-1 as well as the daytime values of 0.89 and 3.07 × 10-6 s-1, respectively. The daytime ME values of the TUV simulation are the largest values shown in Fig. 3, indicating the J-values simulated by the TUV model for the daytime J-values tend to overestimate the real situation. However, the J-ML reduces the deviation between simulated values and observed values with lower ME values, especially in Chengdu and Shanghai. 2.2 Hourly prediction for the next 3-days and 7-days The above analysis indicates that the J-ML can satisfactorily reproduce the J-values of the actual circumstances based on the number of hours, current meteorological and pollutants features entered as input. In this section, the hourly predictions of the next 3-days and 7-days are conducted to illustrate the forecasting capability of the J-ML in hourly scale. The input features for hourly prediction task include not only the number of hours, current meteorological and pollutants features but also the observed J-values. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the J-values at n hr after the t moment (Y(t + n)) are matched with the input parameters (X(t)), including the observed J-values, meteorological, pollutants and periodic variables (i.e., the number of hours) at the t moment, to train the various prediction models, respectively. The input parameters of testing set are same as the training set but different from the time period (Appendix A Table S1). Using the testing set, the predictive tasks of the J-values are conducted by the best prediction models of the J-ML. The observed J-values (Y(t + n)) are used to evaluate the predicted performance compared with the future J-values calculated by the J-ML. Table 3 shows that the statistical evaluation for J-values prediction at different times. All eight J-values show a good performance for different prediction tasks. For example, the mean R values for 1-day prediction of J-values exceed 0.84, followed by a slight decrease to values greater than 0.78 for 3-days prediction. The R values of the 7-days prediction are estimated to be within the range of 0.69-0.71, and IOA values are all over 0.81. Obviously, as the forecast time grows, the predictive performance of J-values decreases gradually. It is worth noting that the J-values are slightly underestimated by the prediction model, especially for J(O1D), J(HCHO_M) and J(HCHO_R). The evaluated performance for the next 3-days and 7-days indicates that the J-ML can achieve finishing short-term forecasting task for the photochemical air pollution. 2.3 The J-ML vs. TUV model in e-OBM The cases selected are suffered from O3 pollution (the O3 concentrations above 75 ppbv) in May, August, and September, representing spring, summer, and fall, respectively. A constant dilution rate, reflecting the dispersion effect of the species, was set to match the 8-hr lifetime of the species (Guan et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2019). Furthermore, the latest 2020 MEIC data is adopted to drive the e-OBM in the three cases. Contrasting experiments are designed to compare the O3 performance of the e-OBM simulation with J-values computed by the TUV model and the J-ML as inputs, respectively. In other words, the hourly input parameters of the e-OBM only change the J-values and others are identical, which is to illustrate the applicability of the J-ML in a numerical model. Fig. 5 shows the simulated performance of J(O1D) by the TUV model and the J-ML in the selected cases of Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou. Although the J(O1D) simulation of the TUV model can reproduce the observed trend, it exhibits poor representation of daytime peaks with high bias. As a result, the TUV simulation performs an overall overestimation in Chengdu and Beijing, an underestimation in Guangzhou, respectively. On the contrary, the J-ML can capture not only high values of J(O1D) during clear weather conditions but also low values of J(O1D) under low solar radiation intensity. The evaluated indicators also present that the J(O1D) simulation of the J-ML outperforms the TUV model in the three cases. The R values of Beijing are improved from 0.93 in the TUV model to 0.96 in the J-ML, Chengdu from 0.80 to 0.93 and Guangzhou from 0.91 to 0.98. Meanwhile, the ME values of Beijing declined from 2.32 × 10-6 s-1 in the TUV model to 1.05 ×10-6 s-1 in the J-ML, Chengdu from 4.76 to 1.71 and Guangzhou from 4.97 to 1.88. According to the contrasting experiments, the J-values simulated by the J-ML and the TUV model are inputted to compute the O3 concentration in the three cases, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the TUV model and the J-ML to O3 concentrations in Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou. It is shown that the O3 concentrations computed by the J-ML are closer to observed concentrations with lower ME (19.57, 16.24 and 16.93 × 10-6 s-1), RMSE (23.49, 19.33 and 21.37 × 10-6 s-1) and higher R (0.70, 0.86 and 0.82) in Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou than those by the TUV model, respectively. The R values increased 4%, 12% and 9%, the ME decreased 4%, 30% and 15%, and the RSME decreased 5%, 34% and 17% in Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou, respectively, which reflected the outstanding performance of the J-ML, making it an excellent supplement for the numerical models. It is also noted that the O3 concentration computed by the J-values of the J-ML still remains biases for the observation. On the one hand, despite the J-values simulation of the J-ML has a good performance, the O3 simulation also underestimates or overestimates in especial time (Fig. 5). For example, the observed O3 concentrations remained 10-30 ppbv during night time in Beijing and Chengdu. The underestimation of O3 in Guangzhou was shown from 27 September to 30 September 2021. On the other hand, the e-OBM also has some uncertainties for O3 simulation, such as the bias of emission in MEIC (Huang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020), the lack of physical transport and loss of radicals in aerosols in the 0-Dimension model (Tan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017b). 2.4 Analysis of the feature importance Fig. 7 shows the SHAP summary plots of J(O1D) and J(NO2) in the four cities. Each point in Fig. 7 is the Shapley value of each sample in various input features. The y-axis represents the input features, ranked from top to bottom in terms of feature importance, and the x-axis represents the Shapley of the corresponding point. The higher the Shapley value, the greater the influence of the feature on the J-values. The color from blue to red indicates the values of the input feature from low to high. It is clear that solar radiation is the primary influencing feature on all J-values, as the intensity of solar radiation directly affects the magnitude of the photolytic reaction rate (Madronich and Flocke, 1999). For different cities, the main influencing factors of the top four rankings are different. Taking J(NO2) as an example, four main input features can be found: Beijing is by SSRD, BLH, V_wind and TCC, Chengdu is by SSRD, O3, CO and T_Mean, Guangzhou is by SSRD, PRS, T_Mean and SO2, and Shanghai is by SSRD, TCC, BLH and RH. The reason for the difference of the top four features is the discrepancy of topographical conditions, climatic conditions, urbanization and air pollution characteristics in different cities. The common important features of J(NO2) are SSRD, T_Mean, TCC, BLH and RH in the four central cities, which have a strong relationship with the NO2 photolysis reaction in the aspects of particle concentration, aerosol properties and reaction rate. Meanwhile, other J-values SHAP summary plots are also shown in Appendix A Fig. S3-S5. Focusing on Beijing, the second and third important features of J(O1D) are T_Mean and RH, and of J(NO2), J(HONO), J(H2O2) and J(HCHO_M) are BLH and V_wind, indicating that J(O1D) is more influenced by local meteorological elements, while the other J-values are more influenced by turbulence effects and horizontal transport. Although the top five ranked significant influences have changed, they are essentially in the top five for different photolysis rates in the same city. In summary, the dominant features for all J-values are SSRD, T_Mean, O3, TCC, BLH, RH and PRS. The SHAP summary plots can also present the impact of the input features on J-values. In terms of J(O1D), SSRD, T_Mean and O3 significantly affect the variation in J(O1D) for all cities and are positively correlated with J(O1D), indicating that the J(O1D) value increases as the SSRD, T_Mean and O3 values increase. On the other hand, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and TCC are negatively correlated with J(O1D), PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and CO concentrations affect the concentration and optical properties of aerosols in the atmospheric environment and TCC affects the strength of the radiative effect. Therefore, when their values are higher the rate of photolysis reaction is more weakened. Moreover, the V_wind has a negative relationship with J(NO2) in Beijing, while has a positive relationship in Guangzhou. This can be explained by the fact that the V_wind of Beijing may bring in polluted air masses (Ma et al., 2008), leading to an increase in atmospheric turbidity and slowing down the photolysis of NO2, while the V_wind of Guangzhou has a diffusion effect, bringing the clean air mass from the ocean into urban area, which results in NO2 being fully exposed to the sunlight (Ji et al., 2023). 3 Conclusions In this study, an automated forecasting system based on machine learning was developed to reproduce and predict the J-values, including J(O1D), J(NO2), J(HONO), J(H2O2), J(HCHO_R), J(HCHO_M), J(NO3_M) and J(NO3_R). The knowledge base contains observed meteorological data, observed pollutants data and model reanalysis data. To handle the regression question of hourly J-values prediction, five common machine models (i.e., MLR, MLP, RF, GBDT, SVR) and SG model were adopted in the J-ML. The automated search for the best \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d was achieved with Bayesian Optimization and a comprehensive index ( C I t o t , j ) in the J-ML. Compared with five sub-models and TUV model, the J-ML has an excellent performance to simulate the hourly J-values with lower MB, ME and RMSE, higher R, P and IOA. The results showed that most of the R values exceeded 0.93, the P values were in the range of 0.68-0.83 and the IOA values were above 0.94 in various cases of the four central cities. A comparative analysis of the whole day and the daytime also showed that not only for the whole day but also for the daytime, the best performing models of all cities outperformed the TUV model in the R and RMSE value. To illustrate the forecasting capability of the J-ML, the hourly predictions of the next 3-days and 7-days are conducted. The results of the next 3-days and 7-days showed that R values are over 0.78 and 0.69, respectively. Then, the O3 concentration calculated by the J-values of the J-ML and the TUV model was compared. Due to the better performance for J-values simulated by the J-ML than the TUV model, the O3 concentration was improved with higher R, lower ME and RMSE in the three selected cases. Therefore, the J-ML can be an excellent supplement to the TUV model. The features importance of J-values was presented using the SHAP model. SSRD was the most important factor for all J-values, and the other dominant factors for all J-values were T_Mean, O3, TCC, BLH, RH and PRS. In the future, to better reproduce the variation of air pollutants, including O3, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO and SO2, the J-ML should be applied to the 3-D numerical models. Thus, a further studying about the automated system is to be an alternative to replace the photolysis module in the CTMs. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

        "dc:description": "Based on observed meteorological elements, photolysis rates (J-values) and pollutant concentrations, an automated J-values predicting system by machine learning (J-ML) has been developed to reproduce and predict the J-values of O1D, NO2, HONO, H2O2, HCHO, and NO3, which are the crucial values for the prediction of the atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) and secondary pollutant concentrations such as ozone (O3), secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The J-ML can self-select the optimal \u201cModel + Hyperparameters\u201d without human interference. The evaluated results showed that the J-ML had a good performance to reproduce the J-values where most of the correlation (R) coefficients exceed 0.93 and the accuracy (P) values are in the range of 0.68-0.83, comparing with the J-values from observations and from the tropospheric ultraviolet and visible (TUV) radiation model in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shanghai. The hourly prediction was also well performed with R from 0.78 to 0.81 for next 3-days and from 0.69 to 0.71 for next 7-days, respectively. Compared with O3 concentrations by using J-values from the TUV model, an emission-driven observation-based model (e-OBM) by using the J-values from the J-ML showed a 4%-12% increase in R and 4%-30% decrease in ME, indicating that the J-ML could be used as an excellent supplement to traditional numerical models. The feature importance analysis concluded that the key influential parameter was the surface solar downwards radiation for all J-values, and the other dominant factors for all J-values were 2-m mean temperature, O3, total cloud cover, boundary layer height, relative humidity and surface pressure.",
