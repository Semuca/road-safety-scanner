(Kohonen, 1990; Jain, 2010). Fig 1 Fig. 2 The frequency of six ozone-favorable synoptic weather pattern (SWPs) types in Guangzhou with different numbers of iteration and operation classified from the SOM and K-means algorithms. Panel (a) shows the results for SOM algorithm. Operating the SOM algorithm by 10 times yield exactly the same results. Panel (b) shows the results for the K-means algorithm. The ten thin lines from each SWP type represents the results from ten operations of K-means method. The thick line represents the average of frequency from the 10 operations. Fig 2 Fig. 3 Consistency between the SOM and K-means classification methods in deriving six ozone-favorable synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) in the four representative Chinese megacities.

Objective weather classification methods have been extensively applied to identify dominant ozone-favorable synoptic weather patterns (SWPs), however, the consistency of different classification methods is rarely examined. In this study, we apply two widely-used objective methods, the self-organizing map (SOM) and K-means clustering analysis, to derive ozone-favorable SWPs at four Chinese megacities in 2015\u20132022. We find that the two algorithms are largely consistent in recognizing dominant ozone-favorable SWPs for four Chinese megacities. In the case of classifying six SWPs, the derived circulation fields are highly similar with a spatial correlation of 0.99 between the two methods, and the difference in the mean frequency of each SWP is less than 7%. The six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou are all characterized by anomaly higher radiation and temperature, lower cloud cover, relative humidity, and wind speed, and stronger subsidence compared to climatology mean. We find that during 2015\u20132022, the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs days increases significantly at a rate of 3.2 day/year, faster than the increases in the ozone exceedance days (3.0 day/year). The interannual variability between the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs and ozone exceedance days are generally consistent with a temporal correlation coefficient of 0.6. In particular, the significant increase in ozone-favorable SWPs in 2022, especially the Subtropical High type which typically occurs in September, is consistent with a long-lasting ozone pollution episode in Guangzhou during September 2022. Our results thus reveal that enhanced frequency of ozone-favorable SWPs plays an important role in the observed 2015\u20132022 ozone increase in Guangzhou. Keywords Ozone (O3) Objective weather classification methods Synoptic weather patterns Trends Guangzhou Introduction Tropospheric ozone, a major air pollutant and oxidant, can inflict severe damage to humans, animals, and vegetation (Paoletti, 2009; Turner et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). It is mainly produced from photochemical reactions of its precursors, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Despite the implementation of emission control policies in China in recent years, ozone concentration in China remains high and continues to rise (Lu et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), reflecting a potentially increasing influence of ozone-favorable weather conditions on ozone pollution. Here, we evaluate the stability and consistency of two weather pattern classification methods in identifying synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) for ozone-favorable in four metropolitans in China, and analyze the effects of interannual variations in SWPs on the recent ozone increasing trend in Guangzhou. Ozone is not exclusively dependent on precursor concentrations but is also controlled by meteorological conditions (Jacob and Winner, 2009; Fiore et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019b). Solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind are the key meteorological factors affecting surface ozone concentration (Wang et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). High temperature and radiation are favorable for ozone production by boosting biogenic emissions of VOCs and expediting the photolysis of NOx (Ainsworth et al., 2012; Pusede et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2021). Higher wind speed and strong vertical mixing can facilitate the ventilation and dispersion of ozone and reduce ground-level ozone concentration (Leibensperger et al., 2008), whereas air stagnation featured by low wind speed and strong subsidence leads to ozone accumulation (Zhang et al., 2015; He et al., 2021). Increase in water vapor content tends to accelerate ozone removal thus decrease ozone concentration (Lu et al., 2019b).Changes in these meteorological parameters are closely associated with evolution of meso-scale or large-scale weather systems. Previous studies have elucidated crucial influence of weather systems, including the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), monsoon system, Meiyu Front, and tropical cyclones, on surface ozone variability in China (Zhang et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Shu et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020b; Jiang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). A useful analytic approach to categorize the dominant weather patterns favorable for air pollution is the weather pattern classification method. The weather classification method is a statistical analysis method based on meteorological data such as sea level pressure and wind direction, which can classify weather patterns based on the spatiotemporal similarity of meteorological elements. This approach encompasses subjective, objective, and hybrid classification techniques (Huth et al., 2008; Stanojević, 2010). Compared to the subjective method, the objective method utilizes automatic algorithms to perform weather pattern classification based on the processing of extensive datasets without any reliance on subjective judgment (Huth, 1996), and is more widely applied in analyzing ozone-favorable weather conditions. The objective weather classification method requires preprocessing and feature extraction of historical weather data, followed by model training and evaluation, ultimately produces different weather types and their interrelationships. An increasing number of studies have applied different objective weather classification methods to identify dominant weather patterns favorable for air pollution in China (Li et al., 2019a; Zhan et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2020). For example, Han et al. (2020) used the self-organizing map (SOM) method to classify six predominant SWPs for ozone pollution in eastern China. The dominant SWPs are associated with integrated influence of the summer monsoon, WPSH, and the typhoon activities, and can influence daily mean surface ozone concentrations by ± 16%. Dong et al. (2020) used T-mode Principal Component Analysis (T-PCA) to study the relationship between summer ozone pollution and weather conditions in the North China Plain (NCP) region from 2014 to 2018. They showed that severe ozone pollution in NCP was linked to anomalous high pressure conditions prevailing in the Northwest Pacific, as well as the presence of a robust low pressure system in Northeast China. Liao et al. (2017) employed the Lamb-Jenkinson objective classification method to classify the weather patterns affecting the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region into ten types, and found that anticyclone circulation and westerly winds contributed to increase ozone concentration. Weng et al. (2020) applied the K-means cluster analysis method to classify six SWPs favoring the accumulation of PM2.5 pollution during dry season in 2013\u20132018 in Zhaoqing city in the South China. While these previous studies have demonstrated successful applications of objective weather classification method in identifying the dominant ozone pollution SWPs in different parts in China, an important question remaining is whether different objective methods are consistent in resulting dominant types and frequency of SWPs with the same input. We also lack a comprehensive analysis on the influence of different classification parameters, including the number of weather types and iteration range, on the resulting SWPs even using the same objective methods. This limits the robustness of the derived ozone pollution SWPs and a broader implication for designing ozone mitigation strategy accordingly. In addition, while several studies have been conducted to investigate potential interannual variations in SWPs, much less attention has been attached to examine whether such variations in ozone pollution SWPs may be responsible for the interannual variabilities and trends in ozone levels over China. In this study, we apply two widely-used objective methods (SOM and K-means clustering analysis) to derive ozone-favorable SWPs at four Chinese megacities representative of different regions in China, i.e. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi'an, based on gridded reanalysis meteorological fields and surface ozone observations in 2015\u20132022. We evaluate the consistency in the circulation pattern and frequency of the derived ozone-favorable SWPs across the two methods, and also examine the robustness of each method in response to different number of operation and iteration. We then analyze meteorological parameters for each ozone-favorable SWP in Guangzhou to investigate the chemical and physical mechanisms inducive to ozone enhancement. Finally, we analyze the interannual variabilities in the ozone-favorable SWPs and surface ozone concentration in Guangzhou to examine the role of weather conditions in the observed deterioration of ozone pollution in the context of anthropogenic emission control. 1 Data and methods 1.1 Meteorological data The meteorological data used in this study are from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset available at the European center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (available at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home). ERA5 dataset provides hourly fields of meteorological parameters at a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. We analyze the data at 00 UTC (08:00 BJT) when routine radiosonde data is assimilated to enhance the accuracy of the reanalysis data. Meteorological parameters used in this study are the sea level pressure (SLP), downward ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the surface, temperature at 2 m (T2m), horizontal wind at 10 m above the surface, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), total cloud cover (TCC), relative humidity (RH) and vertical velocity at the 950 hPa height (W950), and geopotential height data at 500 hPa height. 1.2 Surface ozone observation Hourly ozone measurements in China are from the China National Environmental Monitoring center (available at http://beijingair.sinaapp.com/). The monitoring network was established in 2013 with limited number of sites, and the number of sites expanded to 1436 in China from 2015. The observing measures are in strict accordance with the Chinese national standard, and the data are released after preliminary quality control (Zhao et al., 2016). We use ozone measurements in the period of 2015\u20132022 from 68 monitoring stations at the four key Chinese megacities, i.e. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi'an. These four megacities can be representative of four major city clusters in China with severe ozone pollution, i.e., the North China Plain, the Yangzte River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Fenwei Plain. We calculate the daily maximum 8 h average ozone (MDA8 O3) from the hourly measurements, and use the MDA8 values in our analysis. 1.3 Classification of the SWPs We use two objective weather classification methods in this study, i.e., the SOM algorithm and the K-means cluster algorithm. These two methods have essential difference in their classification strategies. Fig. 1 shows the workflows of SOM and K-means cluster algorithm. The SOM algorithm, initially proposed by Kohonen (1982), is a non-linear neural network model for data clustering and visualization. It is capable of automatically classifying input samples in an unsupervised manner and has been widely applied in the field of atmospheric science (Lu et al., 2010; Mattingly et al., 2016). It employs a Winner Takes All (WTA) competitive learning strategy to compare the input data with the weight vectors of each neuron, and selects the neuron with the closest weight vector as the winning neuron. The SOM algorithm gradually optimizes the network by repeatedly adjusting the weight vectors of the neurons around the winning neuron, using a neighborhood function to preserve the topological structure of the input space (Kohonen, 1990). A key feature of SOM is its ability to preserve the topological structure of the input space and objectively project multidimensional input data onto a two-dimensional output space (Hewitson and Crane, 2002). Cluster analysis is a widely used objective classification method that has proven advantageous in various fields, including climate and meteorological data processing and air pollution research (Kalkstein et al., 1987; Darby, 2005; Govender and Sivakumar, 2020). The K-means clustering algorithm is a representative cluster analysis method. Its basic principle is to assign each sample point to the cluster that belongs to the nearest cluster center. The algorithm can effectively classify weather types by dividing data points into different clusters through iterations until convergence or the maximum number of iterations reaches appropriate K values (Hsu and Cheng, 2016; Weng et al., 2020). The specific steps of the K-means algorithm are as follows. First, the model randomly selects k initial cluster centers. Second, assigns each data point to the nearest cluster. Third, calculates new cluster centers for each cluster, which is the average value of all data points in the cluster. Four, repeats steps 2 and 3 until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached (Jain, 2010). The significant difference between the SOM and K-means classification method is that the initial selection of clustering centers in K-means is randomly chosen, while SOM is not. Our goal is to identify the dominant SWPs and their mechanism contributing to high ozone episodes in a specific city. We start from 2922 daily samples of ozone concentration at the four cities and reanalysis meteorological fields in 2015\u20132022. We then use the 85th percentiles of MDA8 O3 of each year as the threshold to identify high ozone days, so that each year has equal samples to be included in the classification regardless of the yearly difference in ozone levels. We follow previous studies to use the sea level pressure (SLP) field (Liu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2022) of the selected high ozone days covering the domain tailored for each city (25\u201360°N and 93\u2013133°E for Beijing, 18\u201353°N and 100\u2013140°E for Shanghai, 10\u201345°N, 90\u2013130°E for Guangzhou, and 20\u201355°N and 85\u2013125°E for Xi'an) at 00UTC (08:00 BJT) as input to analyze the daily circulation patterns and to derive dominant SWPs, using both SOM and K-means algorithms. The selected spatial domain aims to cover the spatial scale of synoptic system influencing ozone air quality in the broader region, i.e. the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Fenwei Plain. We have checked the results using geopotential height fields at 850 hPa instead of SLP for classification, and similar conclusions can be obtained. We use different numbers of SWP types, operation, and iteration when conducting the classification, and examine their influences on the classification results and the consistency between the two methods. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Stability and consistency of the SOM and K-means methods in ozone-favorable SWPs classification We first examine the stability of the SOM and K-means classification algorithm in response to different numbers of operation and iterations. We use both methods to categorize six ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou for the 2015\u20132022 period as an example. For both methods, we conduct the classification with an iteration number ranging from 500 to 20,000 with an interval of 500 iterations. We also repeat both the SOM and K-means program by 10 times to check whether the results are consistent between each operation. Fig. 2 shows the frequency of each SWP classified from the both methods with different operation times and iterations. We find that for the SOM algorithm, the derived SWP patterns and frequency remain the same for each operation with the same input and fixed number of classification type (six in this case), while for the K-means method, running the program by ten times with the same input yields different results. This reflects the influence of the randomly-chosen initial clustering centers on the resulting ozone-favorable SWPs in the K-means algorithm. Nevertheless, the difference in SWPs between each operation remains relatively small. For example, for the top dominant SWP, running the K-means algorithm by 10 times with a fixed number of 10,000 iterations yields a difference of less than 10% in the SWP frequency, and it does not change the order of dominant SWPs. In addition, we see generally consistent pattern of sea level pressure in resulting dominant SWPs from different operations with a fixed number of 10,000 iterations (Appendix A Fig. S1), indicating that the number of K-means algorithm operations do not significantly change the overall diagnosis of SWPs. We also see from Fig. 2 that for both methods, the frequency of each SWP exhibits a certain level of fluctuation with different number of iterations, but the overall patterns and frequency remain consistent. For the SOM algorithm, the frequency of each SWP type becomes stable and convergent with a fluctuation range of less than 1% after the number of iterations exceeds 10,000. In comparison, fluctuation in the SWPs frequency between each iteration from the K-means algorithm is larger, typically within a range of 10%, and the fluctuation does not weaken even after 20,000 iterations. The above feature suggests that in this Guangzhou case, SOM is more stable than the K-means algorithm in terms of the response to different numbers of operation and iterations, yet both methods show relatively good stability in the derived SWPs and their frequency. Fig. 3 and 4 compare the derived frequency and the spatial distribution of sea level pressure from each SWP between the SOM and K-means algorithm in the Guangzhou case. As shown in Fig. 3, we find outstanding consistency in the resulting SWPs from both methods. The frequencies of the six ozone-favorable SWPs are 26.0%, 20.6%, 15.6%, 14.9%, 14.5%, and 8.4% from the SOM algorithm at the iteration of 10,000, respectively, while the mean corresponding frequencies are 24.2% (22.6−29.6%) (the range for each operation), 20.6% (20.6−24.0%), 16.3% (13.4−16.7%), 14.7% (12.2−15.8%), 13.6% (10.0−14.9%), and 10.6% (7.0−10.9%) from the K-means algorithm at the same iteration number of 10,000 (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 further illustrates that the spatial distribution of sea level pressure from each SWP between the SOM and K-means algorithm are very similar with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0.99. We also explore the consistency of the results of two methods for classifying the ozone-favorable SWPs with different numbers of categories. Appendix A Fig. S2 and S3 show the results for four and eight categories, respectively. It shows that the two methods have high consistency in the classification results for four categories. However, classification of only four categories may lost important and more detailed information on the ozone-favorable SWPs, and some typical SWPs (such as subtropical high type which has been identified in many previous studies) are not reflected. When the classification type extending to eight, the two methods are less consistent (Appendix A Fig. S3). Therefore, we suggest that classification to six SWPs provides both good consistency between the two methods while allowing us to specify SWPs as much as possible at least in the Guangzhou case. We repeat our test of the consistency between the two classification methods on classifying six ozone-favorable SWPs in other three representative megacities, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an. Results are summarized in Figs. 3, 4, and Appendix A S4-S6. We find that the resulting order, frequency, and the spatial distribution of the sea level pressure, wind field, and geopotential height fields at 500 hPa for each SWP is all consistent between both methods in all the three cities, with the difference in the mean frequency of each SWP obtained from the two algorithms less than 7%, indicating that both methods can yield robust ozone-favorable SWPs in megacities at different parts in China. The derived circulation fields are highly similar with a spatial correlation of 0.99 between the two methods at the above cities. In Beijing and Shanghai, the derived SWP frequency shows a larger fluctuation in the K-means than the SOM algorithm, which is the same as Guangzhou, while in Xi'an, the SOM algorithm shows higher fluctuation in the frequency for the top three dominant ozone-favorable SWPs. The derived ozone-favorable SWPs in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an are also consistent with previous studies (Gao et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023). For example, the heaviest ozone pollution in North China Plain is found to be associated with a high pressure anomaly over the Northwest Pacific and a distinct low pressure center in Northeast China (Dong et al., 2020), this is similar to Type4 with the highest ozone concentration obtained by our methods (Appendix A Fig. S4). We conclude that although the SOM and K-means algorithm have essential difference in the classification strategy, they are largely consistent with each other in identifying the ozone-favorable SWPs. 2.2 Dominant SWPs and their related meteorological conditions inducive to ozone enhancement in Guangzhou Our analysis in Section 1.1 provides strong confidence to apply either of the two weather classification methods in estimating ozone-favorable SWPs. We now analyze the six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs from SOM method at the iteration number of 10,000, with a focus on Guangzhou (Fig. 4). This is because many previous studies have been focusing on ozone pollution in the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta (e.g. Dong et al., 2020; Shu et al., 2019), and that the severe ozone pollution in autumn 2022 in Pearl River Delta region has attracted increasing interest. We summarize the six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs from their major features in the sea level pressure fields as the Uniform Pressure field type (UP, Type1, 26.0%), the Typhoon Periphery type (TP, Type2, 20.6%), the Subtropical High type (SH, Type3, 15.6%), the Weak surface Cold High pressure type (WCH, Type4, 14.9%), the Transformed cold High Ridge type (THR, Type5, 14.5%), and the Strong surface Cold High pressure type (SCH, Type6, 8.4%). Fig. 5 a displays monthly occurrence for each SWP in Guangzhou. The UP (Type1) type exhibits the highest occurrence frequency, characterized by a uniform low surface pressure field over most of the eastern and southern regions of China, resulting in prolonged periods of stagnation and calm weather conditions with poor dispersion, mainly in June-August. The TP (Type2) type is featured by a cyclone circulation field near the southeastern coast of the Taiwan Island, while Guangzhou is controlled by subsidence from the WPSH or the peripheral air of the typhoon, leading to air stagnation. This type mainly occurs between May and September. The SH (Type3) type primarily occurs in September and autumn, characterized by the widespread coverage of WPSH in Southern China, leading to high atmospheric stability and hot and dry weather conditions. The WCH (Type4) type is mainly distributed from September to April, with the high-pressure center located in the East China Sea. Guangzhou is situated in the south of the high center, under the influence of a ridge area that extends southward from the center of high pressure. The THR (Type5) type is mainly distributed in April and May, usually occurs after a cold high weakens, moves eastward and southward, and denatures and disappears in the East China Sea. The SCH (Type6) type accounts for the lowest percentage and mainly occurs in October and November. This type is featured by a strong cold high located in the Inner Mongolia region, and Guangzhou is located at the forefront of the cold high during this period. Most of the above ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou are generally consistent with previous studies from both subjective and objective classification results of forecasters. For example, these studies have pointed out that the Western Pacific Subtropical High, periphery of tropical cyclones, and continental anticyclones systems are key synoptic patterns inducive to ozone pollution in the Pearl River Delta region (Huang et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022b). Fig. 5b shows that the rank of the mean MDA8 ozone values from the six ozone-favorable SWPs does not follow that of the SWPs occurrence frequency. The highest ozone concentration is around 88 ppbv for the THR (Type5), followed by the TP (Type2) of 85 ppbv, while SCH (Type6) of has the lowest average ozone concentration of 77 ppbv. This feature, however, does not solely reflect the seasonal pattern of each SWP and ozone concentration. For example, the THR (Type5) with the highest ozone concentrations is mainly distributed in April and May, which is not the typical ozone-favorable (September-November) in Guangzhou. This drives us to further examine the weather pattern and meteorological parameters corresponding to each type. We analyze the ozone enhancement related meteorological parameters associated with each SWP to understand the ozone difference and the underlying chemical and physical mechanism. We first calculate the daily daytime (11:00\u201318:00, local time) mean values of UV, T2m, TCC, RH, W950, wind direction, wind speed, and PBLH at 14:00. We then subtract the monthly mean value from each daily data point to remove the seasonal influence on these meteorological parameters. Data for each ozone-pollution SWP are composited to describe the weather anomaly (Figs. 6 and 7 ) compared to the mean value (Appendix A Fig. S7). As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the meteorological characteristics associated with these ozone-favorable SWPs are strong solar radiation, high temperature, slight cloud cover, low humidity, weak horizontal wind, high boundary layer height, and air subsidence. Fig. 6 shows the anomaly of daytime radiation, temperature, total cloud cover, relative humidity anomalies fields in ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou. The three SWPs with the highest MDA8 values (The THR (Type5), TP (Type2), and SH (Type3)) show the largest positive anomaly in temperature and solar radiation in terms of magnitude and spatial extent, compared the other three SWPs with lower ozone concentration. During the three ozone-favorable SWPs, daytime radiation levels and temperature in Guangzhou are found to be 17.7−26.8% and 0.9\u20132.2 °C higher than the average levels. Strong solar radiation and high temperature increase ozone concentrations in multiple ways (Sillman and Samson, 1995; Atkinson, 2007; Jacob and Winner, 2009; Doherty et al., 2013). High solar radiation facilitates the photolysis of NOx and expedite the formation of ozone. Higher temperature boosts the emissions of biogenic VOCs and NOx, and the volatilization of some anthropogenic VOCs (Ma et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). In addition, high temperature can catalyze the production of HOx (HOx = OH + H + peroxy radicals), facilitate the decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs), and accelerate the molecular motion of various reactants and the photochemical reaction rate, thereby promoting generation of NO2 and ultimately the formation of ozone. The three SWPs with the highest MDA8 values also show the largest negative anomalies in TCC and RH, 0.3\u20130.6 and 10.9−15.2% less of TCC and RH than the monthly average in Guangzhou, respectively. This is due to the inhibitory effect of clouds on ozone production accompanied with solar radiation as analyzed above, as well as their ability to enhance ozone removal by modulating liquid-phase chemistry and photochemistry (Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1990). Higher relative humidity corresponds to more water vapor content, which is conducive to the moisture absorption growth of aerosols that can weaken solar radiation and thereby hinder ozone production (Zanis et al., 2000; Dueñas et al., 2002). In addition to the localized photochemical reactions, the physical transport also plays an important role in accumulation of ozone concentrations (Gong and Liao, 2019). Fig. 7 shows the anomaly of daytime wind speed, wind direction in ozone-favorable SWPs compared to the average value. We observe a decrease in the horizontal wind speed of various patterns, especially in the vicinity of Guangzhou. Wind speed of the three SWPs with the highest MDA8 values are found to be 0.8\u20131 m/s slower than the average levels. In addition, we note that the UP (Type1) type typically occurs during the wet season (June-August) when the dominant wind in Guangzhou should be southerly, but we find an anomaly increase in northly wind component in this weather type. Similarly, the THR (Type5) type typically occurs during the cool season (February-May) when northerly winds are dominant, but we find an increase in southward wind component. The confrontation between the anomaly local winds and the dominant winds can lead to the accumulation of pollutants, severs as an additional factor contributing to high ozone levels in these SWPs. Besides horizontal transport between regions, vertical transport and diffusion are also key factors affecting ozone concentration. Fig. 7 also shows the anomaly of PBLH and near surface vertical velocity compared to the average level in each ozone-favorable SWP. The THR (Type5), TP (Type2), and SH (Type3) have largest positive anomalies in the boundary layer height with a largest spatial coverage and 229.2\u2013371.4 m higher than the monthly average. PBLH reflects local temperature conditions, as turbulence is more intense at a higher temperature. Ozone increases with altitude even in the boundary layer, as supported by tower-based or sonde measurement in Guangzhou (Li et al., 2022a; Mo et al., 2022). The higher PBLH features increases in turbulence intensity that favors greater mixing between the upper and lower layers and allows ozone-rich air in the upper layer mixed into the ground (Sun et al., 2010; He et al., 2022). We also find that all SWPs exhibit air subsidence with vertical velocity below 0 cm/s. In addition, the three SWPs with the highest MDA8 values also show negative anomalies in vertical velocity, 0.2\u20130.9 cm/s less of vertical velocity than the average in Guangzhou. The occurrence of large-scale downdraft in TP and SH may be related to the influence of Typhoon Periphery and WPSH. 2.3 Interannual variations of ozone-favorable SWPs and their impacts on ozone trend The above analysis has identified the top six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou based on the 2015\u20132022 data. We now investigate the potential linkage between the interannual variations in the ozone-favorable SWPs occurrence and the variability of ozone concentration. We do not directly use the yearly cases with each SWP returned from the classification algorithm, because these cases have been selected based on prior information of daily ozone levels (Section 1.3). Instead, we aim to recognize the days with weather pattern that is similar to the ozone-favorable SWPs regardless of ozone pollution level, so that climatic effects on ozone level can be independently examined. Therefore, we use the SLP fields in the identified six ozone-favorable SWPs as a set of benchmarks, and develop a method to recognize the yearly number of days that are with similar SLP pattern to these ozone-favorable SWPs. This is also beneficial for the prediction of ozone pollution simply from SLP fields, without re-conduction of classification and any prior information of the ozone level. We use the following strategy to recognize the yearly number of days that are with similar weather pattern to a classified SWP. We illustrate the method from an example to recognize the frequency of the Type1 weather in 2015. First, we use the daily sea-level pressure field of Type1 in 2015 as a benchmark field, and calculate the spatial correlation coefficient between the benchmark field and the daily sea level pressure field of each day in 2015. Second, we set the threshold of correlation coefficient to 0.9, and days with correlation coefficient higher than this threshold are regarded as days with weather patterns similar to Type1. We note that the selection of threshold may influence the number of recognized ozone-favorable SWPs, but does not influence the overall trends. Similar approaches are applied to recognize the yearly occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs for other years and types, with the fixed threshold for all years. Fig. 8 shows the interannual variations in ozone-favorable SWPs recognized from the above method. It reveals an increasing trend in the total number of SWPs over the years, with the lowest count in 2017 and the highest in 2022. We find that the number of ozone-favorable SWPs associated with cold air outbreaks in the dry season (October-April), including WCH (Type4) and SCH (Type6), has increased from 9 in 2015 to 17 in 2022. Meanwhile, the percentages of the two most frequent weather types (UP (Type1) and TP (Type2)) during the wet season (May-September) has decreased. It indicates that the increasing numbers of WCH (Type4), THR (Type5), and SCH (Type6) which could be one of the contributing factors to the observed increase in ozone levels during the dry season. Several other studies have also found that ozone pollution events have gradually spread to the winter and spring seasons in the past few years in PRD, and some attribute the ozone increase to the reduction in NOx emissions (Zeren et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2023). Our study also finds a significant increase in the frequency of TP (Type2), SH (Type3), and THR (Type5) (corresponding the highest ozone concentration) in 2022 compared to other years. Especially, the number of SH (Type3), which typically occurs in September which high mean MDA8 ozone concentration of 84 ppbv (Fig. 5), reaches to 27 in 2022, 203% higher than the mean of 2015\u20132021. The overall increase in the occurrence of SWPs indicates a growing negative effect from climate on ozone pollution in Guangzhou since 2015. We defined days with MDA8 O3 exceeding 160 μg/m3 as ozone exceedance days. Fig. 9 compares the annual changes in the number of ozone exceedance days and days with ozone-favorable SWPs recognized by the above method. We observe an increasing trend in both the ozone exceedance days and the occurrence of ozone SWPs days from 2015 to 2022. The linear trend for the ozone-favorable SWPs days is 3.2 day/year, slightly higher than the trend in ozone exceedance days of 3.0 day/year. The interannual variabilities of the ozone-favorable SWPs occurrence and the ozone exceedance days are generally consistent with a temporal correlation coefficient of 0.6. In particular, the significant increase in the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs in 2022, especially the increase in SH (Type3), is consistent with the long-lasting ozone pollution events in September 2022. These results suggest that the enhanced frequency of ozone-favorable SWPs plays an important role in the observed 2015\u20132022 ozone increase in Guangzhou. Fig. 9 also shows an increase in the probability of the occurrence of ozone exceedance during the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs. In 2015, when ozone-favorable SWPs occur, the probability of ozone exceedance episode is only 30%. This probability increases to 51.7% in 2019 and 56.6% in 2022. The increase in the probability of ozone pollution during ozone-favorable SWPs suggest that factors other than the worsening weather conditions, most likely changes in anthropogenic emissions, are also contributing to the deteriorating ozone pollution in Guangzhou since 2015. The anthropogenic-driven ozone increase may be attributed to the faster decrease in NOx emissions than VOCs emissions in high-NOx environment such as the urban Guangzhou, and the increases in photolysis and decreases in radical uptakes on the surface of aerosol with the emissions (Zheng et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b; Shen et al., 2019). In summary, our results based on analyses of ozone-favorable SWPs suggest that both changes in weather conditions and anthropogenic emissions together contribute to the ozone increase in Guangzhou since 2015, which is consistent with other studies based on regression model and chemical models (Ding et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Liu and Wang, 2020; Xu et al., 2023). 3 Conclusions This study uses two objective synoptic weather classification methods, the SOM algorithm and K-means clustering analysis, to derive ozone-favorable SWPs in four typical Chinese megacities from 2015 to 2022. The consistency and robustness of the derived ozone-favorable SWPs across the two methods are quantitively evaluated. The differences in meteorological factors between each ozone-favorable SWP and mechanisms affecting ozone concentration in Guangzhou are analyzed. The relationship between the long-term trend of ozone concentration and the interannual variabilities in ozone-favorable SWPs is examined to analyze the climatic effect on ozone increase in Guangzhou since 2015. We find that the two different weather classification methods, based on different principles for classification, are largely consistent in the recognition of typical ozone-favorable SWPs, with similar percentages and high similarities in the derived circulation fields. This consistency can be found at all the four cities examined in this study. Overall, the k-means method results have a larger fluctuation range in the derived frequency of each SWP, while SOM has a relatively smaller range of fluctuation and faster convergence. Our analysis suggests great robustness of either SOM algorithm or K-means clustering analysis in studying weather classification. In the case of classifying six ozone-favorable SWPs, the derived circulation fields are highly similar with a spatial correlation of 0.99 between the two methods at all four cities, the difference in the mean frequency of each SWP is less than 7%. We identify six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou, including UP (Type1), TP (Type2), SH (Type3), WCH (Type4), THR (Type5), and SCH (Type6). The ozone concentration of the THR (Type5) (dominantly in spring and autumn) is the highest, following by TP (Type2) and SH (Type3) (dominantly in summer and autumn), while the ozone level of SCH (Type6) is the lowest. The meteorological characteristics of ozone-favorable SWPs are characterized by higher radiation, temperature, and boundary layer height, lower cloud cover, relative humidity, and wind speed, and stronger subsidence, compared to the monthly average fields. These features become more prominent and cover a larger area with higher values deviating from the monthly mean during the occurrence of SWPs with the highest ozone concentration such as THR (Type5), TP (Type2), and SH (Type3). We also find that the percentages of the main weather types (UP (Type1) and TP (Type2)) during the wet season (May to September) have a slight decline, while the percentage of types (WCH (Type4), THR (Type5), and SCH (Type6)) during the dry season increase since 2015, supporting the observed increase in ozone pollution during the spring and winter seasons. We observe an increasing trend in both the ozone exceedance days and the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs days, with a temporal correlation coefficient of 0.6. We identify an increasing trend in both the number of days with ozone exceedance days (3.0 day per year) and the yearly occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs from 2015 to 2022 (3.2 day per year). The increase in the yearly occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs indicates a growing impact of weather conditions on ozone pollution. In particular, we suggest the large increase in ozone-favorable SWPs has an important contribution to ozone pollution in Guangzhou in 2022. Nevertheless, the probability of ozone exceedance in a given ozone-favorable SWPs increased during 2015\u20132022, which exceeds 50% in 2019 and 2022, suggesting that influences from anthropogenic emission changes are also important. Our study adds new insights into the application of weather classification methods to analyze the contribution of weather conditions to ozone pollution. The classification method provides an effective means to identify the impact of weather without the conducting comprehensive model sensitivity experiments. It also indicates that as ozone-favorable SWPs are increasing in recent years, more stringent emission control measures to mitigate ozone are required to compensate the adverse climate effects on ozone in Guangzhou.

        "dc:description": "Objective weather classification methods have been extensively applied to identify dominant ozone-favorable synoptic weather patterns (SWPs), however, the consistency of different classification methods is rarely examined. In this study, we apply two widely-used objective methods, the self-organizing map (SOM) and K-means clustering analysis, to derive ozone-favorable SWPs at four Chinese megacities in 2015\u20132022. We find that the two algorithms are largely consistent in recognizing dominant ozone-favorable SWPs for four Chinese megacities. In the case of classifying six SWPs, the derived circulation fields are highly similar with a spatial correlation of 0.99 between the two methods, and the difference in the mean frequency of each SWP is less than 7%. The six dominant ozone-favorable SWPs in Guangzhou are all characterized by anomaly higher radiation and temperature, lower cloud cover, relative humidity, and wind speed, and stronger subsidence compared to climatology mean. We find that during 2015\u20132022, the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs days increases significantly at a rate of 3.2 day/year, faster than the increases in the ozone exceedance days (3.0 day/year). The interannual variability between the occurrence of ozone-favorable SWPs and ozone exceedance days are generally consistent with a temporal correlation coefficient of 0.6. In particular, the significant increase in ozone-favorable SWPs in 2022, especially the Subtropical High type which typically occurs in September, is consistent with a long-lasting ozone pollution episode in Guangzhou during September 2022. Our results thus reveal that enhanced frequency of ozone-favorable SWPs plays an important role in the observed 2015\u20132022 ozone increase in Guangzhou.",
