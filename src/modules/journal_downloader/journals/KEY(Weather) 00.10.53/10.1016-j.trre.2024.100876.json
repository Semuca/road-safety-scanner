Fig. 1 Flow chart of the included studies. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Factors Effecting Water/Fluid Balance after Kidney Transplantation. The factors effecting water/fluid balance differs in the early and late period of KT. In the early period high water/fluid intake may be recommended due to understandable reasons such as high initial immunosuppressive dose of immunosuppressant, previous surgery and urine concentration defect. In the late period there may be diluting defect in some kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs) possible due to increased ADH action. Forcing water/fluid intake may not be feasible in this patients but minimum amount of water/fluid must be discussed personally. To note, not all kidney transplantation recipients probably have concentrating and diluting defect due to heterogeneity among them. The exact period of transition from concentration to diluting defect is not known as well as whether this transition occurs in all KTRs or depends on baseline graft characteristics. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Factors Affecting Water Intake in Kidney Transplant Recipients. There are many possible factors influencing water/fluid intake in kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs). These include but not limited to sense of thirst, seasonal changes, exercise level, nutritional behaviors and duration of dialysis treatment. As these change in every KTRs, the water/fluid intake should be arranged individually by discussing with the physician as a shared decision making. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 The Unknowns of Water/Fluid Intake in Kidney Transplant Patients. Despite a very vital issue, surprisingly there are various unknowns regarding water/fluid intake in kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs). These include amount and type of fluid intake, tracking of water/fluid intake, effect of social support, water/fluid intake in special group of KTRs (e.g. de-novo nephrolithiasis, frequent urinary tract infection) and physician recommendations.

Although kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment option for end-stage kidney disease, long-term complications such as chronic kidney allograft dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders are observed. To decrease these complications, preventive measures must be applied in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). One of these common measures is the increase of water/fluid intake although this is not evidence-based practice. Indeed, surprisingly very limited studies evaluated the impact of increased water/fluid intake on graft function, with small number of KTRs and short term follow-up. We suggest that the water/fluid intake should be personalized based on baseline graft function, time onset after KT (which water homeostasis changes), presence of hyponatremia and hypervolemia, concomitant medications, and patient willingness. Methods for estimating water/fluid intake (direct measurement, 24-h urine volume measurement, urine osmolarity) has both advantages and drawbacks and the best method has not been identified. Increase of water/fluid intake in specific conditions (in hot, and humid weather, before exercise, during Ramadan fasting) or in distinct KTRs (KTRs with de novo nephrolithiasis, frequent urinary tract infections) is not tested. Furthermore, the relationship between water/fluid intake and major cardiovascular adverse events are not known. There is no doubt that minimum amount of water/fluid intake is necessary for graft function (the amount is not known) but there is no evidence for a particular target level of water/fluid intake. In the current review, we summarize the studies assessing fluid/water intake in KTR, explained the pathophysiologic basis of water disorders in early period of KT and late after KT, elucidate conflicts and unknown issues of water intake in KTRs and suggest future research needs.

One of these common practices is to increase water/fluid intake [1]. In general population, daily water or fluid intake of at least eight glasses is reinforced, although the evidence is sparse and conflicting [2]. On the other hand, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are advised by their physicians to take more fluid intake even up to maximum of 4 L although this behavior is the results of various misconceptions [3]. Except for specific indications such as nephrolithiasis, polycystic kidney disease or primary hyperoxlauria [4,5], limited studies show conflicting results with regard to increased water/fluid intake various outcomes. It was argued that increased water intake slow progressıon of CKD by suppression of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Increased copeptin as a surrogate marker for AVP has been hypothesized to increase kidney damage by vasoconstriction, glomerular hyperfiltration, increased renin-angiotensin system activity, insulin resistance and inflammation [6]. However, studies are inconsistent and while some studies showed that increased water intake is beneficial with regard to kidney and cardiovascular outcomes [7,8] others showed either negative [9] or no association [10]. In patients with CKD, studies investigating the impact of water intake is also conflicting. Recent epidemics of CKD of unknown origin in Central America, which is probably related to insufficient water intake and chronic volume depletion, were reported and named \u201cMesoamerican nephropathy\u201d [11]. A recent study, found a U-shaped association with both low (< 1 L/day) and high (> 2 L/day) water intake related with progression of CKD [12]. To complicate the things even further, older experimental evidence suggest that high water intake ameliorated glomerular [13] and tubulointerstitial injury [14] by decreasing AVP. Indeed, high copeptin levels; a surrogate marker of AVP, has been associated with worse cardio-renal outcomes [15] and suppressing of AVP by high water intake is suggested to improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular hyperfiltration and sclerosis [16]. There are also studies assessing the impact of water intake in late stages of CKD. Clark et al. randomly, assigned 29 adults with stage 3 CKD (estimated GFR 30\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria) to two groups of water intake: hydration (n:18) or standard (n:11). Hydration group increased their water intake by 1.0\u20131.5 L/day in addition to usual intake for 6 weeks, while the control group carried on with their usual intake. Between baseline and 6-week follow-up, the 24-h urine volume increased by 0.7 L/day in hydration group and decreased by 0.3 L/day in control group (p: 0.002) with no significant changes in urine, serum osmolality or electrolyte concentrations, or eGFR were observed [17]. In a more recent randomized trial, 631 CKD patients with mean eGFR of 43 mL/min/1.73 m2; increased hydration with water intake (increased 0.6 l/day vs. control group) did not significantly slow the decline in kidney function after 1 year [18]. In kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), little is known about water/fluid intake and related outcomes. Moreover, In KTRs, the demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that may be related to water/fluid intake is not known [19]. This is surprising since every physician most probably faced a question: \u201cHow much do I need to take water daily?\u201d This question is particularly pertinent to patients seen in nephrology, internal medicine, kidney transplantation or cardiology clinics. Although transplant clinicians generally advise patients to stay \u201cadequately hydrated\u201d, e.g., approximately 2\u20133 L/day, the impact of water intake practices on graft function over time is not well described. Furthermore, amount of water/fluid intake per day and season may vary by transplant center [20]. There is no definitive recommendation for water/fluid intake in KTRs, except for in the case of primary hyperoxaluria, where the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Kidney Transplant Recipient Guideline offers a class 2C recommendation increased oral fluid intake to enhance urinary dilution of oxalate [21]. Thus, there is even less and conflicting data regarding the water intake in KTRs. Of note, it must be stressed that while recommending to KTRs to be well-hydrated, the water intake independent of other fluids are important although the amount of distinct water recommendation is not specified in literature. For example, although sugar sweetened beverage intake is also included in total fluid intake, increased consumption of sugar sweetened beverage has been shown to increase mortality in KTRs [22]. Previous literature showed that a limited number of studies have addressed water/fluid intake in KTRs. In the current review, we have summarized these studies, explained the pathophysiology of water disorders in the early and late period after KT, elucidate conflict and unknown issues of water intake in KTRs and suggest future research proposals regarding water/fluid intake in KTRs. 2 Methods We performed review of the literature in English language until May 2024 using major online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar) using the key words \u201cfluid intake and renal transplantation\u201d, \u201cfluid intake and kidney transplantation\u201d, \u201cwater intake and renal transplantation\u201d, \u201cwater intake and kidney transplantation\u201d, \u201cgraft function and fluid intake\u201d, \u201cgraft function and water intake\u201d, \u201curine osmolarity and renal transplantation\u201d, \u201curine osmolarity and kidney transplantation\u201d. After screening of the studies, only studies with at least once measured or estimated fluid/water intake, estimated urine osmolarity, measurement of 24-h urine output (last 2 as surrogate of (water/fluid intake) in KTRs were included. The flow chart of the included studıes were shown ın Fig. 1 . 3 Results We identified only 4 studies meeting selection criteria (Table 1 ). Some observational [20,23] or interventional [24] studies showed that increased fluid/water intake was not associated with GFR in KTRs. One retrospective study showed that increased water intake >2000 mL in KTRs with pathologic graft changes (interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis) at the time of transplantation was associated with faster GFR decline. On the other hand, there was a positive relationship between water intake and GFR in KTRs without pathological graft changes, suggesting baseline graft quality may be important when evaluating the impact of water intake in KTR [25]. With regard to relationship between water intake and proteinuria/albuminuria (other markers for kidney function), one interventional study found that urinary protein excretion was not altered by high fluid intake (water intake was not specified) [24], while another observational study has shown that urine protein excretion was increased as 24-h urine volume (as a surrogate of water intake) increased [23]. No study evaluated the impact of water intake on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). There were no specific studies in populations for which water intake may be hypothetically useful based on etiology of end stage kidney disease (nephrolithiasis, polycystic kidney disease). 4 Discussion In the current review, we summarize available studies specifically investigating the impacts of water/fluid intake in KTRs. Surprisingly, very few studies have addressed this topic. Interestingly, studies have shown that increased water/fluid intake did not improve graft function and have neutral effect. Only one study showed that high fluid intake was associated with better GFR, particularly in patients with baseline kidney biopsy findings without interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis. However, only 3 patients in this study had daily water intake greater than 3000 mL. On the other hand, the same study showed that in KTRs with baseline kidney graft interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis, increased water intake >2000 mL/day was associated with worse GFR. This suggests that the impact of increased water intake on graft function might differ between histologically healthy or pre-diseased grafts [25]. What do these data tell us? Do we need to abandon the increased water intake to protect kidneys - a central dogma that is familiar to most people? Although the true answer to this question is not known due to limited data, we do not think it is advisable to limit water/fluid intake, bearing in mind the lack of evidence for exact water/fluid intake in KTRs. We believe that a personalized approach should be implemented since the differences between graft characteristics, time of onset after KT, medications used, and patient characteristics are important. In the following sections, we described the difference between water homeostasis in the early and late period of KT, factors affecting water/fluid intake in KTRs, conflicting and unknown issues, and suggest topics in need of future research. 4.1 Water Hemostasis after KT In hemostatic conditions, extracellular fluid and blood osmolality are kept between certain limits by coordination of various sensors in brain, heart and kidney [15]. However, in patients with CKD, these mechanisms may be perturbed. Indeed, in CKD both urine concentration (due to reduced GFR and dysfunction of counter-current mechanism) and dilution probably due to excess AVP action are disrupted [26]. The water hemostasis after KT is a complex issue and many factors effect this balance ( Fig. 2 ). Going back to 1986, Pedersen et al. demonstrated that in KTRs, an elimination oral water occurs more slowly than in healthy subjects, suggesting a diluting defect in these patients. The average duration since transplantation was 63 months (range 3\u2013166) but the analysis was not specified according to time after KT [27]. Another study has shown that free water excretion capacity is frequently reduced in KTRs [28]. In a recent retrospective study including 1258 KTRs, Mazloum et al. performed water-loading test after 3 months of KT to assess osmoregulation performance which 164 healthy candidates for kidney donation served as controls. Unlike controls, most kidney transplant recipients failed to maintain plasma sodium during water loading suggesting urine diluting effect and decreased free water clearance in KTRs. Hyponatremia (Na < 135 mmol/L) was observed in 365 KTRs (29 %) but only one healthy candidates at the end of the test suggesting impaired osmoregulation in KTRs. Moreover, steeper plasma sodium reduction during the test independently associated with the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, lower GFR and allograft loss at 12 months [26]. All these data contrast with the notion that KTRs are advocated to maintain high water intake to prevent dehydration, especially during the late post-transplantation period [26]. Indeed, fluid intake >3 L/day is commonly recommended in KTRs with resultant polyuria. The assumption that suboptimal function of the post-transplant proximal tubule is associated with a concentration defect, which can lead to dehydration, may have reinforced this practice [24]. While this assumption may be true in the immediate post-transplant period, recommendations mandating high fluid intake subsequently may not be beneficial [29]. Since some KTRs may have also diluting defect as suggested above [26], automatically provoking high fluid intake may be not have beneficial effects. While there is no debate about the dangers of fluid depletion especially early KT [30], a widespread recommendation fluid intake of >3 L/day in the post-transplant period is not evidence based and may be harmful [29]. In light of the above data, one may suggest that high fluid intake may be appropriate in the early period after KT to reduce drug toxicity (as high doses used in early period) and due to decreased proximal tubule dysfunction and concentration defect in some KTRs. However, late in the KT period, there may be a diluting defect in the allograft [26,28] which may predispose to hypervolemia if high water/fluid intake is followed, with resultant graft dysfunction due to renal congestion [31]. In addition, increased water intake may cause edema in the graft resulting in tubular compression and ischemia although this hypothesis has not been established in transplanted kidneys to date, but has been observed in patients with heart failure [32,33]. However, many important questions remain. First, the exact time regarding the shift from concentrating defect to diluting defect in the graft is not specified. Second, whether this shift occurs in every KTRs is not known. Third, it is not defined whether baseline histologic parameters of graft impact this shift. These are all unanswered questions warranting further investigation. While addressing water hemostasis after KT, oral intake must be also considered. Indeed, oral intake may change between early after and late after KT. It was suggested that patients early post-transplant are more likely to be adherent to clinicians fluid intake recommendations given their high motivation, compared with later post-transplant period [20]. Thus, patients may automatically increase their water/fluid intake in the early period; a condition that must be taken into consideration. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that high water/fluid intake can be encouraged in the early post-operative period where concentrating effects and drug toxicity risks are highest, if no contraindications exists such as hyponatremia and hypervolemia. However, in the later period; the high water/fluid intake may not be advisable at least in some KTRs (the exact period is not known) due to limitation or defect of free water excretion capacity necessitating individualized approach. Of note, as suggested above; the time period of this shift and implications for the optimal amount of water/fluid intake have not been specified in for the early and late KTR. 4.2 Factors affecting water intake after KT Aside from lack of data about the optimal amount of water in KT, there are a lot of clinical practice gaps with regard to water/fluid intake in this population (Fig. 3 ). These include but are not limited to (i): the distinction between water intake and fluid intake which also includes tea, coffee and sugar-sweetened beverages etc. is not specified in most studies. Thus, while recommending the patients to be well-hydrated, the amount of water recommended is not specified in literature (ii): Only few KTRs receive specific comments about water/fluid intake by their physicians. In a survey based study, it was demonstrated that 37 % of KTRs did not receive any specific recommendations about how much water/fluid to drink; but advised only to drink plenty of fluids (without mention of water) [1] (iii): Some KTRs think that their amount of fluid intake is already good because they are naturally \u201cbig drinkers\u201d although the amount of this \u201cbig drinking\u201d was not specified [1]. (iv): Feeling full or more urinating with more water consumption may be a burden to patients which was not reported in previous studies. (v): Previous behaviors learned during dialysis to limit fluid intake may lead to continued fluid intake limitations after KT. One study showed that KTRs which are on dialysis therapy for more than 3 years restrict daily fluid intake more compared to patients with dialysis therapy less than 1 year. Thus, the transition from low fluid intake to normal fluid intake may be more stringent in KTRs with more history of dialysis therapy [1]. Thus, bearing in mind that the absolute amount of water intake is not known in KTRs, in some patients with suspicion of low-water intake the causes of this behavior may have many roots. 4.3 What to suggest about water/fluid intake in KTRs? The literature about intake of fluid/water in KTRs is very limited and no specific guideline addressed this issue based on solid evidence. Moreover, there are a lot of knowledge gaps (Fig. 4 ). One of the most important issue is whether routine habitual water drinking should be advised without the sense of thirst in KTRs. This question has no definite answer but at this time, we believe probably not. As suggested, none of the studies (although limited in number) showed beneficial impact of high water/fluid intake with regard to graft function. Additionally, high water/fluid intake (amount not specified in the literature) may be feasible in the early transplantation period but not in the late period of KT, as water homeostasis differs in the early and late period of KT. Still, we believe that a minimum amount of water/fluid intake is necessary for proper graft function but this amount may differ for individual patients. Yamagana et al. suggested that 1000\u20132000 mL of water intake daily may be optimal for KTRs [25] However, this suggestion is based on only one study and more studies are needed to suggest firm conclusions. In addition, some KTRs already applied this habitual water intake by their self not to experience dehydration. By using semi-structured review, 21/82 of KTRs reported intentional fluid intake (not specified as water) without thirst and 15/82 of KTRs reminded themselves to drink and stayed aware of the need to drink, although the outcomes of this behavior were not followed [1]. There are also special considerations that needs to be addressed. Firstly, there is no doubt that KTRs have different characteristics. Even at the same level of graft function, there is wide heterogeneity with regard to osmoregulation [26] needing personalized approach and shared decision making. Second, studies are not present whether water intake during different seasons, especially increasing in hot and humid weather or before exercise, needs to be automatically increased in KTR. The education of KTRs may be important in this context and to automatically increase their water content when at facing exposure that pose risk for dehydration. Moreover, KTRs may learn to check their urine color (darker, more dehydrated) or skin turgor. All these issues are unknown in KTRs and studies are needed. Third, the impact of asking about water intake routinely by the physician -a simple measure- needs to be tested. This may seem very simplistic at first glance as above, a study showed that 37 % of KTRs did not receive any specific recommendations about how much fluid/water to drink [1]. Another important issue is the fact that it is not known the best tracking method for fluid/water intake in KTRs. Gordon et al., reviewed fluid intake in 88 KTRs by surveys and fluid adherence was determined if KTRs drink ≥3L of fluid of daily although water intake not measured specifically. Thus surveys may be used to tract water/fluid intake in KTRs although more studies are needed in this issue [19]. Apart from above mentioned self-management issues (urine color, skin turgor etc.) and direct measurement of water intake, 24-h urine volume and urine osmolality measurements as proxy measures of water intake or combination of them can be used. Although urine volume measurements seems accurate, one must remember that approximately 60 % of total water output occurs via urine and the remaining occurs through gastrointestinal and insensible losses [34]. In a healthy individual, urine specific gravity reflects renal free water clearance and hydration status. However, calcineurin inhibitors may increase and chronic interstitial fibrosis may decrease urine specific gravity, making interpretation of this parameter in KTRs more problematic [35]. In the outpatient setting, measuring of urine output may be used but is subject to error, can be burdensome to patients, and is also affected not by only water intake but also by total fluid intake. Directly measuring water intake by bottle or drinking glass has been used. Indeed, this method was studied in pediatric KTRs [35]. However, this study measured fluid intake and not specifically water intake per se. Although, fluid intake was increased by bottle use, the increase of fluid intake did not impact kidney function negatively or positively, although the study duration was only 28 days [35]. Whether living alone or with family number may also be important. For example, KTRs reported relying on family members to remind them to drink or bring them fluids [1] implying the importance of social support. This is also important because the adherence of KTRs to water/fluid intake regimens may be problematic, especially in long term even under supervision [24]. There is also a knowledge gap regarding the specific KTRs for whom increased water intake may be beneficial such as KTRs with de-novo nephrolithiasis, with recurrent urinary tract infections, or those who working in hot and humid conditions. One of the unknown issues is the effect of Ramadan fasting. Some studies have showed that Ramadan fasting did not adversely affect graft function [36,37]. However, a meta-analysis showed that GFR decreased in fasting KTRs versus non-fasting KTRs although these results were associated with significant publication bias (systematic heterogeneity). Importantly, there were no changes of GFR before and after Ramadan fasting with patients acting as their own controls, a data exploited from 5 studies [38]. It was suggested that KTRs wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment, and medication assessment, plan for regular monitoring of graft function and electrolytes and recommendations including fluid ıntake. Patients in very high risk and high risk according to International Diabetes Federation and the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance categories should not fast and KTRs with low/moderate risk category may be able to cautiously fast with guidance from their clinician with close follow-up [39]. Of note, the optimal fluid/water intake is either not established in these patients. Last but not least, whether water intake effects MACE or blood pressure regulation has been not studied in KTRs. 5 Conclusion Surprisingly, in KTRs, studies investigating water/fluid intake and its clinical correlations are scarce, involving small number of patients with short follow-up periods. Limited evidence supports that forcing patients to increase water/fluid intake to 3\u20134 Liters/day is not beneficial, although the needed minimum amount of fluid/water intake is to be determined. We thought that this should be not fixed to certain absolute level but rather personalized based approach is needed depending on a variety of factors, including thirst, physical activity levels, salt taste perception, level of graft function, presence of hyponatremia, and hypervolemia, concomitant use of other drugs, presence of obesity, and presence of diabetes. It seems rational that in the early period of KT (what is this early period should be defined more precisely in further studies) water/fluid intake could be increased (to what level is not known) due to concentration defect and fear of immunosuppressive toxicity where the dosages are maximum. However, later on, high level of water/fluid intake should not be forced due to transition from concentrating defect to diluting defect of graft at least in some KTRs. In addition, currently no study showed the beneficial effects of high fluid/water intake on graft function. We also believe that both physicians and patients should be flexible in their regimens and tailor to exposures, for example, by increasing their fluid intake in hot humid weather and before exercise. Self-management strategies may be implemented such as control of urine volume and turgor of skin. It also needs to be tested whether new e-health technologies will be useful in tracking water intake and urine volume in KTRs. Furthermore, trials could also be undertaken in high risk KTRs such as those with urinary tract infections or renal calculi to evaluate high water/fluid intake and graft and cardiovascular outcomes. In conclusion, the role of water/fluid intake and their impact on graft function is not well-studied in KTRs but remains a very important topic warranted future study. Various knowledge gaps must be filled with well-planned, prospective, and randomized controlled studies. Study funding None declared. Declaration of competing interest None.

        "dc:description": "Although kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment option for end-stage kidney disease, long-term complications such as chronic kidney allograft dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders are observed. To decrease these complications, preventive measures must be applied in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). One of these common measures is the increase of water/fluid intake although this is not evidence-based practice. Indeed, surprisingly very limited studies evaluated the impact of increased water/fluid intake on graft function, with small number of KTRs and short term follow-up. We suggest that the water/fluid intake should be personalized based on baseline graft function, time onset after KT (which water homeostasis changes), presence of hyponatremia and hypervolemia, concomitant medications, and patient willingness. Methods for estimating water/fluid intake (direct measurement, 24-h urine volume measurement, urine osmolarity) has both advantages and drawbacks and the best method has not been identified. Increase of water/fluid intake in specific conditions (in hot, and humid weather, before exercise, during Ramadan fasting) or in distinct KTRs (KTRs with de novo nephrolithiasis, frequent urinary tract infections) is not tested. Furthermore, the relationship between water/fluid intake and major cardiovascular adverse events are not known. There is no doubt that minimum amount of water/fluid intake is necessary for graft function (the amount is not known) but there is no evidence for a particular target level of water/fluid intake. In the current review, we summarize the studies assessing fluid/water intake in KTR, explained the pathophysiologic basis of water disorders in early period of KT and late after KT, elucidate conflicts and unknown issues of water intake in KTRs and suggest future research needs.",
