Accurate machine learning (ML) predictions for the early stages of the building design are crucial to construct energy-efficient buildings utilizing limited resources. Several studies have employed ML methods for energy consumption (EC) prediction without considering the utmost crucial PCM-integrated building design parameters. In addition, reducing the dataset by considering only the most significant building design parameters before applying the ML-based method would be beneficial for reducing the computational power and memory usage of the system as well as utilizing less time in the modelling process. To this end, this research presents a novel framework to establish the most robust and reliable ML-based prediction model with less complexity, considering only the most influential PCM-integrated building design parameters. These parameters were identified for future scenarios of hot semi-arid (BSh) climate zones using multi-stage sensitivity analysis. Afterward, a reduced EC database based on the most significant building's early-design-stage parameters (EDSPs) was utilized to formulate several multi-expression programming (MEP) and support vector machines (SVM)-based forecasting models, considering the variations in their hyperparameter values. Formulated prediction models have shown less time utilization through the training and testing phases for the EC evaluations of selected PCM-integrated building compared to the physical-modelling process. Several statistical parameters were used to test and validate the performance of the formulated prediction models. The acquired model evaluation and validation results demonstrated that the MEP-based prediction model (MEP15) exhibited the highest level of reliability and accuracy, showing an R2 value of >95% for both the training and testing phases. The model's interpretability showed that, throughout the parametric analysis, the developed prediction model adhered to the system's physical boundary constraints. Also, the best-performing prediction model showed energy savings of up to 12% for building integrated with PCM having a melting temperature of 28 °C. Conclusively, this research demonstrated that the developed MEP-based prediction model could be employed to precisely forecast the EC for selected PCM-incorporated building in the whole BSh climate, considering important EDSPs while utilizing minimal resources.

Observational data has indicated that implementing passive design can result in savings of over 50% in total primary energy consumption (EC) [1]. An effective passive design aimed at minimizing energy demand for comfort involves numerous features of building design including factors as the orientation, wall thickness, insulation levels, window specifications, incorporation of sunroofs for passive solar heating, shading mechanisms, etc. [1]. Among these methods, the use of phase change materials (PCMs) in buildings has proven to have a noteworthy effect on controlling thermal loads, leading to considerable energy reduction. PCMs are used to mitigate cooling and heating loads in the building due to their substantial capacity for storing energy during phase transitions, thus maintaining acceptable thermal comfort levels. Data-driven-based methods have gained popularity for estimating the EC in buildings [2]. The prediction models based on machine learning (ML) methods can monitor the EC of buildings to make intelligent decisions for the construction of energy-efficient buildings utilizing the physical modelling-based database. ML methods can uncover the hidden patterns and correlations among the dependent and independent variables in large datasets by leveraging algorithms and statistical models to provide predictions for the automation of decision-making processes to construct energy-efficient buildings using limited resources [3,4]. In this context, several researchers [4\u20139] have proposed the best-performing forecasting models to predict the performance of buildings without incorporating PCM, adhering to the defined objectives of their studies using multiple ML methods. For instance, gene-expression programming (GEP) [5], multi-expression programming (MEP) [5], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [5], gradient boosting (GB) [6], support vector machines (SVM) [6,7], gaussian process (GP) [6], adaboost [6], extra-trees classifier (ET) [6], k-nearest neighbor (k−NN) [6], random forest (RF) [6,7], decision trees (DT) [6], deep neural networks (DNN) [8], multi-fold semi-supervised learning method based on deep neural networks (DUMSL-DNN) [8], and artificial neural network (ANN) [9] were utilized to forecast the EC of buildings without PCM incorporation. The precise EC estimation of PCM-incorporated buildings through machine learning methods is of utmost significance in effectively exploiting the advantages of this revolutionary approach. ML methods help to reduce complexity and non-linearity during the performance evaluation of PCM-incorporated buildings [10], which can provide significant ease of understanding when constructing eco-friendly buildings considering parameters for building design. These methods can also provide an optimized selection of the PCM layer's thickness, melting temperature, and type of PCM for the construction of energy-efficient buildings based on historical, simulated, or experimental database. A trained, best-performing ML predictive model for the performance evaluation of PCM-incorporated buildings, considering the building envelope characteristics, environmental parameters, and energy efficiency measures, can generate generalized results according to the new building construction scenarios and climates, reducing the extensive experimental testing and numerical simulations [10\u201313]. Yang et al. [11] optimized the performance of PCM-integrated building using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic-Algorithm III (NSGA III) algorithm for the developed EC prediction model by stacking model of ML in Shenzhen, China. Their findings indicated that the Stacking model, when compared to eight diverse ML models, exhibited superior performance in forecasting the EC, demonstrating high correlation efficiency (R2 = 0.97). Bagheri-Esfeh et al. [12] employed the Grouped-Method of Data-Handling (GMDH) to investigate the integration of PCM for improving the energy efficacy of heating and cooling systems in a domestic building located in Tehran. They considered factors such as internal gain, thickness of PCM layer, melting point of PCM, infiltration rate, and walls thermal resistance. The findings indicated that the R2 value exceeded 0.9 for both cooling and heating energy, confirming the reliability of the prediction models. Further, Nazir et al. [10] developed a gene-expression programming (GEP)-based estimation model for the EC estimation of PCM-integrated building in the tropical savanna climate. Their research showed the reliability of the GEP-based EC prediction model, with an R2 value exceeding 95%. In another study, Zhussupbekov et al. [13] formulated several ANN, SVM, and regression-based prediction models to forecast the monthly energy use of PCM-integrated buildings utilizing a database of EC related to several building design parameters. They found that the ANN-based model was the most effective at forecasting the EC of PCM-incorporated buildings, having an R2 value of >95%. When developing a prediction model for a dependent variable, it is important to avoid using several irrelevant independent variables, as they utilize a lot of resources and could make the model more complicated and less accurate. Therefore, evolving a prediction model that takes into account the reduced database of influential factors to forecast EC can reduce the time required for training a ML-based prediction model and could potentially increase the precision and reliability of the prediction models due to the few independent variables and the smaller size of the dataset. The implementation of a sensitivity analysis (SA), which essentially evaluates the significance of variables by carefully analyzing the association among independent variables and EC in terms of variability measures, is becoming increasingly vital [14]. Prior studies [15,16] present several SA methods to examine the EC of buildings. These investigations solely relied on the utilization of single-stage sensitivity analysis methods. Nevertheless, single-stage sensitivity analysis methods tended to omit the significant design parameters [17]. The utilization of multiple sensitivity analysis methods may be a viable option for identifying the most important design parameters [1,18]. Yang et al. [17] suggested using multiple sensitivity analysis methods to obtain more accurate results. Therefore, application of multi-stage sensitivity analysis (MSA) in evaluation of important design parameters is crucial. This technique employs numerous SA methods to assess the performance of buildings by focusing on the most influential design parameters, which aim to reduce the utilization of resources during the evaluation process through physical modelling. In this context, Saurbayeva et al. [19] identified the crucial initial stage building design parameters to reduce the EC of PCM-integrated building in the tropical savanna climate, utilizing less time for the energy simulation process. They found that up to 42.7% of EC can be reduced using the right combination of building design parameters during the early stages of a PCM-integrated building's design. It is pertinent to mention that MSA-based energy evaluations for the most influential building design parameters can be utilized to establish a more robust and reliable ML-based prediction model using limited resources. To address these concerns, this research presents a novel framework for developing a robust ML-based prediction model for estimating EC in buildings for future weather conditions using MSA to identify the most influential building design parameters for reducing utilization of resources (system's computing capacity with less usage of storage and time) during the prediction model's training process. MEP and SVM are proposed to formulate several prediction models considering variations in the values of their hyperparameter to find the best-performing prediction model for the estimation of PCM-incorporated buildings' EC, utilizing less time during model training and validation processes. MEP and SVM have the ability to interpret the hidden pattern of data for the formulation of the most robust and reliable prediction model to minimize the presence of outliers in the predicted database. To get a robust and reliable forecasting model among the several MEP and SVM-based prediction models, these models would be evaluated and validated using statistical metrics. Afterward, the behavior of the developed best-performing prediction model for the prediction of EC would be evaluated through parametric and energy-saving analysis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research roadmap The research roadmap (Fig. 1 ) is based on four major steps: 1) Representation of building model and energy simulations; 2) Multi-stage sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential EDSPs and reduce the dataset for the formulation of ML-based prediction models; 3) Formulation of several MEP and SVM-based prediction models to forecast the energy utilization of PCM-integrated building for the whole BSh climate zone; 4) Model evaluation and validation to obtain most robust prediction model. 2.2 Overview of building model For this research, a 4-storey mid-rise building model created by the US Department of Energy (DOE) was considered as the baseline model. These prototype buildings have been constructed and simulated across various climatic regions, making them adaptable to different climate conditions [20]. The typical floor area comprises 3130.83 m 2 (46.329 m × 16.916 m) and the floor height is 3 m. The aspect ratio of the building is 2.74, while the window-to-wall ratio is 20%. The building's walls in the baseline model are composed of stucco, gypsum board, and an insulation layer, while the roof in the baseline model consists of built-up roofing, an insulation layer, and a metal surface. The proposed building model incorporates PCMs into the baseline model. The modifications comprise adding a PCM layer in both walls and roof. In the walls of the PCM- integrated model, PCM was incorporated between the insulation layer and gypsum board; in the roof, it was mounted between the insulation and metal surfaces. The exterior walls with PCM consist of five layers: 15.9 mm of gypsum board, 20.0 mm of PCM layer, 50.8 mm of insulation layer, another 15.9 mm of gypsum board, and 25.4 mm of stucco layer. The roof structure consists of four layers: 0.8 mm of metal surface, 20.0 mm of PCM layer, 50.8 mm of insulation layer, and 9.5 mm of built-up roof layer. The layer thicknesses were selected based on building model prototypes [21]. The building model and the details of the construction layers are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 . Table 1 lists each building element's layers from exterior to interior, specified by thickness, thermal resistance, conductivity, specific heat, and density. The building employed a packaged terminal heat pump (PTHP) system, in line with ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1\u20132013 [22]. Humidity levels were maintained at 25% for humidification and 60% for dehumidification, following BS EN 15251 standards [23]. The infiltration rate was established at 0.7 air changes per hour [24]. The HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system for residential building was scheduled to operate from 00:00 to 08:00 and from 16:00 to 24:00 h (Fig. 4 ), adhering to the recommendations provided in [25]. 2.2.1 Selection of building design parameters and performance objectives In sensitivity analysis and optimization, the parameters subject to variation are called design parameters. The present research examined numerous EDSPs, including passive design measures. EDSPs often includes building layout and dimensions, the composition and thermophysical properties of the envelope, the window-to-wall ratio, infiltration, overhang projection ratio and air-tightness [26,27]. The most significant components influencing EC in buildings are the thermal characteristics of the external building envelope, including the roofs, windows, and walls [28]. Building orientation also impacts EC due to its impact on natural heating of envelope from solar gain based on the building's position relative to the sun [29]. Thermal energy storage systems also impact EC, and incorporating PCMs can save energy while improving interior comfort [30]. This research examines several EDSPs concerning building layout, energy-efficiency measures, and thermal envelope characteristics. Eleven EDSPs affecting building performance are selected for the MSA (Table 2 ). To investigate a broad range of PTm, PCM peak melting temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 30 °C with a melting range of 4 °C were considered. The latent heat capacity of PCM was taken as 219 kJ/kg, in accordance with [31,32]. The predetermined ranges for the EDSPs have been derived from previous literature [33\u201335], and are summarized in Table 2. The building's basic settings were established using base case values from the related DOE reference model. Each parameter was adjusted within its designated lower and upper range values for the sensitivity analysis. To ensure accurate assessments of crucial design parameters across different cities, consistent ranges have been applied. Moreover, these parameters have been treated as continuous variables and uniformly distributed within their designated ranges. The total energy consumption (TEC) of the building, which comprises the sum of the annual cooling and heating loads, is treated is the performance objective. The calculation is expressed by the equation: (1) TEC = EC heating + EC cooling where, EC heating represents the annual EC for space heating (kWh/year), and. EC cooling represents the annual EC for space cooling (kWh/year). 2.2.2 Climate and weather files The BSh climatic zone was selected for this research based on the Köppen-Geiger map [36]. This climate zone is characterized by consistently high temperatures and solar radiation throughout the year. Within the BSh zone, winters are typically mild, while summers can be hot, occasionally reaching extreme temperatures [37]. To develop a common estimation model applicable to the whole climate region, six cities from the entire climate region were selected. These cities include Ahmadabad, Lahore, Marrakesh, Port Elizabeth, Tripoli, and Windhoek. More details on terrestrial data are presented in Table 3 . This research utilized future weather files generated through a hybrid downscaling methodology. The term \u201chybrid downscaling method\u201d refers to a strategy that combines both numerical and dynamical downscaling methodologies to provide future climate data. In this approach, the wider climate context is provided by large-scale climate model forecasts, which are then used to downscale the information to finer scales using statistical method [38]. The hybrid downscaling method strives to give more precise and trustworthy future weather data for particular regions or places by combining the advantages of both methodologies. For this research, the future weather data was purchased from White Box Technologies [39], who are professional in the generation of future weather. The monthly averages of outdoor air-dry bulb temperature, solar radiation, and humidity for future climate scenarios (RCP 8.5) in the BSh zone are presented in Fig. 5 . 2.2.3 Energy simulation and validation The building's energy performance was modeled using EnergyPlus, with the building geometry represented through the graphical interface of DesignBuilder. The U.S. DOE [34] developed EnergyPlus, a comprehensive software tool, to analyze the energy performance of whole buildings. Notably, EnergyPlus allows users to model the influence of PCMs through the Conduction Finite Difference algorithm and includes a validated PCM-algorithm that adheres to ASHRAE Standard 140 [10]. It employs a finite difference method (FDM) to discretize the building envelope into multiple nodes, allowing for flexible accuracy in heat transfer equation calculations. This research utilized an enthalpy-temperature function with a fully implicit FDM to account for phase transition energy. The fully implicit CondFD algorithm is illustrated in Eq. (2), while the enthalpy-temperature function used for simulations are presented in Fig.6 . (2) C p ∆ x T i j + 1 − T i j ∆ t = k int T i + 1 j + 1 − T i j + 1 ∆ x + k ext T i − 1 j + 1 − T i j + 1 ∆ x where, (3) k w = k i + 1 j + 1 + k i j + 1 2 (4) k E = k i − 1 j + 1 + k i j + 1 2 (5) k i = k T i j + 1 where: T is the node temperature; k is the thermal conductivity: k int is the internal nodes thermal conductivity; k ext is the external nodes thermal conductivity; k E is thermal conductivity for the interface between nodes i and i-1; k w is thermal conductivity for the interface between nodes i and i + 1; ∆ t is the computation time step; ∆ x is the finite-difference layer thickness; ρ is the density of a material; C p is the specific heat of material; i is a node being modeled; j is simulation time step; j + 1 previous simulation time step; i + 1 and i-1 denote adjacent nodes to the exterior and interior constructions, respectively. For this research, the PCM integrated model utilized a spatial discretization constant of 3, a 2-min time step, and a nodal space set at one-third of the default value, following the recommendations of [40]. To assess the reliability of EnergyPlus for simulating buildings with PCMs, we compared experimental data from our research team [41] with the results of simulation for an identical model in DesignBuilder. The experiment, conducted in Shenzhen, China, involved a lightweight aggregate concrete cubicle measuring 500 mm × 500 mm × 500 mm with walls 20 mm thick (Fig. 7 ). The effect of PCM, with a peak melting temperature of 23 °C, on the internal temperature measured at the center of the room was examined. Using the Shenzhen city weather dataset [42], the experimental setup (Fig. 7) was replicated and simulated in DesignBuilder for two consecutive days. The values of room air temperature acquired from numerical models and experimentation are shown in Fig. 8 . The outcomes demonstrated that there was only a 4.5% difference between the simulated and experimental findings. Therefore, the model developed in DesignBuilder is suitable for analyzing thermal and energy performance [43]. Furthermore, numerical and analytical solutions to Stephan's problem were applied, as presented in the Tabarase-Velasco research [40]. Fig.9 displays the analytical and numerical solutions to Stefan's problem. The outcomes indicate a strong agreement between the two solutions, validating the accuracy of the PCM implementation. The numerical model accurately predicted heat flow with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 18.1 W/m2. 2.3 Multi-stage sensitivity analysis Multi-stage sensitivity analysis (MSA) is essential for identifying crucial EDSPs that significantly influence the energy use of residential PCM-integrated buildings within the BSh climate zone. This research utilizes MSA to reduce the datasets for the utilization of ML techniques to predict the EC of the buildings. By systematically evaluating the influence of parameters on EC at different stages, MSA facilitates the recognition of the most significant parameters. This data eliminates less important parameters, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient dataset. This method enhances model interpretability, improves computational efficiency, and contributes to the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. In general, the application of MSA ensures that the reduced dataset maintains crucial information required for effective model training and prediction. The MSA proceeds through a two-step process, with each stage improving our understanding of the complex interaction of parameters. In the initial stage, three distinct global sensitivity analysis techniques are employed: Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC), Standardized Rank Regression Coefficients (SRRC), and the Morris method. This stage comprehensively quantifies the extent of EDSPs' effects on EC. Following the first stage of MSA, parameters are ranked to find the key design parameters. After parameter ranking, important EDSPs are chosen and subjected to a local sensitivity analysis (LSA) to identify the direction of each parameter's influence on total EC. The utilization of a single-stage sensitivity analysis approach may result in missing key design parameters [17]. As a result, MSA is useful for showing the extent and direction of the impact of EDSPs on output. The MSA procedure, as depicted in Fig. 10 , involves the utilization of R software, EnergyPlus, and jEPlus. The process starts with using R to generate a variety of input samples, each of which represents a different set of parameters for building simulation. These samples are organized into a job list and provided to jEPlus, which executes simulations through the EnergyPlus engine. For each simulation run, measures of total EC are obtained and sent back to R for analysis. 2.3.1 MSA methods According to Saltelli & Marivoret [44], PRCC and SRRC were identified as the most efficient and reliable sampling-based indexes. Furthermore, the regression method is computationally cost-effective, while the Morris method is suitable for problems involving numerous inputs. SRRC is a widely adopted technique in the field of building performance simulation, particularly in models characterized by non-linear relationships between input and output parameters [45]. The building performance simulation community frequently employs SRRCs to assess sensitivity [33,46]. This method involves performing regression analysis on rank-transformed data, where original parameter values are replaced with their ranks [47]. By using a regression model, the relationship among model input and output parameters can be explored. The regression model for analyzing the reliance of model output on input parameters is as follows: (6) y i − y m S y = b 1 s y i − y m S x 1 + b k s x k − x i , m S xk = ∑ i = 1 k SRC y x i x k − x i , m S x 1 where, x i , m , y m denotes the model output's average value: Y = ( y 1 , \u2026, y N ); X i = ( x 1 i , \u2026, x Ni ) denotes input parameter; S y , S xi denotes model output's standard deviations (Y) and input parameter ( X i ); b 1 s , \u2026 b k s denotes the coefficients for standardized regression; model runs represented as N. PRCC permits for the identification of statistical associations between input and output parameters, while keeping other inputs constant [48]. This method displays the independent effects of each parameter, regardless of their correlation. Only output parameters exhibiting a monotonic correlation with the inputs are considered. PRCC evaluates the strength of the monotonic relationship between an input parameter and an output [49]. PRCC is determined for each input and output parameter in the following manner. The process involves adding an additional column to the input values and outcome vector, representing the ordinal rank of each value (K + 1) within its respective column. For example, for the input values r 1 i , r 2 i , \u2026, r ki and the outcome value R i , where i is the run count, the mean rank μ= 1 + N 2 [50]. A symmetric matrix C, with dimensions K + 1 by K + 1, is then created, with components denoted as c ij . (7) c ij = ∑ t = 1 N r it − μ r jt − μ ∑ t = 1 N r it − μ 2 ∑ s = 1 N r js − μ 2 i , j = 1 , 2 \u2026 , K . R i substitutes r jt and r js in the c i , k + 1 elements. All leading diagonal components of C are equal to one while matrix B is defined as the inverse of C. (8) B = b ij = C − 1 Among the i th input constraint and the y th output constraint, the PRCC ( γ iy ) is specified as: (9) γ iy = − b i , K + 1 b ii b K + 1 , K + 1 The Morris method is notably effective in identifying non-influential parameters with a limited sample size and determining the interaction between the outputs. It could produce very accurate sensitivity indices for the inputs at a low computational cost. Morris's approach yields two sensitivity indices: the mean value and the standard deviation [51]. The average value assesses the overall impact of an input component on the output, while the standard-deviation evaluates the interactions of input parameters with other factors. The model, y(x), has an output parameter y and a vector of input parameters x within the interval. To sample the parameter space, inputs are converted into dimensionless variables in the range (0,1), split into p levels, creating a unit-length hypercube grid H k . A trajectory consists of k + 1 localities where each parameter variations once by ∆ i . One model run is signified by a point on this trajectory, allowing for the calculation of the coefficient-of-variation for each input variable i, known as the elementary effect (EE), between two locations when input parameter i changes. (10) EE i = y x + e i ∆ i − y x ∆ i where, e i is a zero vector, excluding for the i-th factor, which equals ±1 and indicates an incremental variation in parameter i [52]. The statistical parameters of the EE are utilized to assess the model's responsiveness to each design parameter (Eqs. (11)\u2013(13)). (11) μ i = 1 r ∑ t = 1 r EE it (12) δ i = 1 r − 1 d ∑ t = 1 r EE it − μ i 2 (13) μ i ∗ = 1 r ∑ t = 1 r EE it where, μ represents the average of the elementary effect (EE), which measures the input's influence on the output. δ is EE's standard deviation, indicating the extent of how the input interacts with other inputs and the non-linearity of its impact on the output [47]. μ ∗ is a novel extent developed by Campolongo et al. [51] to assess the entire impacts of the inputs on the model outcome. r is the amount of EE observed for each parameter, and t represents each trajectory within the parameter's sample space. LSA, which belongs to the second stage of MSA, is a one-factor-at-a-time approach that computes sensitivity measures by changing one parameter while keeping all other values constant. In contrast to the comprehensive nature of the first stage techniques, LSA is relatively straightforward, making it simple to apply and understand [16]. The local sensitivity index (LSI) is calculated according to Eq.(14). (14) S local , i = Y max , i − Y min , i Y max , ∗ where, Y min , i and Y max , i are the minimum and maximum values of the output in the i-th input parameter, S local , i is the local sensitivity index, Y max , ∗ is the maximum global output among all the input parameters. 2.4 Machine learning methods The utilization of ML methods for the estimation of energy use in buildings has become a revolutionary strategy to improve energy efficiency in building design [2,53]. The use of sophisticated ML techniques enables accurate prediction of buildings' EC by taking into account parameters including weather conditions, occupancy patterns, architectural characteristics, and energy systems [2,53]. In this research, two ML algorithms, namely MEP and SVM, were used to establish a reliable and precise forecasting model to estimate the EC of PCM-integrated buildings by considering the most influential EDSPs. MEP, an evolutionary computation technique, evolves a mathematical expression for the developed model by capturing the intricate patterns and relationships of the building's EC database during the model training and validation processes. This technique produces the best-performing prediction model due to its scalability, using ensemble learning for multiple running models simultaneously [5]. SVM performs well in high-dimensional spaces to make reliable predictions for buildings' EC by avoiding overfitting the model and successfully intricating the non-linear relationships of input variables with EC. High-dimensional spaces may include EC evaluations by considering building characteristics, weather conditions, occupancy patterns, equipment usage, etc., as input variables [6,13]. The chosen ML methods in this research possess the ability to replicate the correlations between input and output variables, which is in line with the operating principles of physical modelling-based building simulation tools. These methods have utilized the EC database for PCM-integrated buildings generated by the building simulation tool (EnergyPlus), considering only the influential EDSPs to develop the forecasting model for reducing resource utilization during the future EC predictions in the particular climate zone. The best-performing prediction model would be user-friendly to obtain the required EC results for PCM-integrated buildings with quick responses compared to building simulation tools. The specifics of these methods are presented in the following subsections. 2.4.1 Multi expression programming A linear variant of ML algorithms, known as MEP, has emerged in recent years. In this variant, an expression of any length represents each entity [5,10]. It is a state-of-the-art genetic programming-based method that utilizes linear chromosomes (c) to encode solutions. Thereafter, the optimal gene is selected by relating it to the fitness-values, leading to the ultimate solution. Improper expressions and division by zero are easily tackled by MEP [5]. Changing a defective gene to a random terminal symbol ensures that unproductive offspring make it to the following generation. This causes a gap to open up in the chromosomal structure as the examination progresses. The operation of MEP is illustrated in Fig. 11(a) [5,54]. Machine coding, like the \u201cc\u201d and Pascal compilers, has an empirical relationship to MEP decoding [54,55]. By combining mathematical operators or variables, the MEP generates a linear sequence of instructions. While genes dictate chromosomal function and composition, several genes on a single chromosome control chromosome length. The given expression tree (Fig. 11(b)) suggests that the sample MEP programme is encoded using the following sets of variables: Function set (F) = \u201cPow, +, /\u201d and Terminal set (T) = \u201cA1, A2, A3, A4\u201d [56]. A computational programme can incorporate the MEP genes by means of top-down chromosomal decoding. Fig. 11(b) depicts gene trees for the corresponding programs; genes denoted by 0, 1, 3, and 4 indicate individual terminals (Y0 = A1, Y1 = A2, Y2 = (AoA1)2, Y3 = A3, and Y4 = / (A2A3), Y5 = A4, Y6 = (A4 + A5). On chromosomes 0 and 1, gene-2 encodes the expression Y2 = Pow (A1. A2) by allocating the \u2018Pow\u2019 function to operands. In the same way, at positions 2 and 3, gene-4 represents the operator \u201c/ \u201con the operands and encodes the expression as Y4 = A1A2 /A3. The expression Y4 = A1A2 /A3 + A4 which is the result of gene six will be attainable at some point during programming. After determining the degree to which various expressions are executed on the MEP chromosome, it is possible to design an ideal expression tree [5]. It is essential to fit frequent aspects into the MEP-model to develop a generalized relationship. Simple mathematical operators were employed in this research to derive expressions, and fitting parameters were determined by the trial and error methods [5,10]. Over-fitting issues arise from complicated and lengthy convergence processes caused by large populations, therefore, the population size was carefully calibrated. This research investigated the effectiveness of the MEP in predicting EC in six cities within the BSh climate zone, considering the most influential EDSPs. These parameters were used as independent variables in MEP (MEPX software version 2018) to build a mathematical expression for the forecasting model. In order to build a generic and robust model, different MEP's fitting parameters (Table 4 ) were adopted to reach an optimal solution. The variations in these parameters were chosen based on prior recommendations [5]. While a huge population might lead to more sophisticated and accurate model runs, it may also take an exceedingly lengthy time for the model to converge. To ensure that the total length is unaffected by the gene count on each chromosome, the MEP genes are composed of substrings of varied lengths. Each gene carries a terminal or function symbol. A gene that additionally holds pointers to the function's arguments encodes a function symbol. Regardless of the function's placement on the chromosome, the index values of its parameters are consistently reduced [5,55]. 2.4.2 Support vector machines SVM is a kind of controlled ML algorithm that is used for the analysis of data to solve classification and regression problems [57,58]. One notable advantage of SVM is its ability to mitigate the issue of overfitting, as it excels in both fitting the training data and generalizing to unseen data. SVM demonstrate strong performance when applied to long-term time series data. Further, SVM effectively manages non-linear problems through the use of kernel functions [59]. The conceptual working structure of SVM utilized for this research is depicted in Fig. 12 . To enhance precision, SVM has the capability to convert the input space into a higher-dimensional space through the utilization of a non-linear transformation. This transformation is specifically determined by an inner product function [13]. The theoretical purpose of SVM is to determine the hyperplane that exploits the disparity among the two types of observations. According to the illustration presented in Fig. 13 , the solid line is postulated to represent the ideal hyperplane [60]. The term \u201csupport vector\u201d refers to the set of observations that lies closest to the best possible hyperplane. The boundary is a hyperplane aligned parallel to the optimal hyperplane and intersects with the support vectors of a specific class. The margin refers to the distance between the boundaries. During the training phase of SVM prediction model, the training data can be represented as a set of observations (x1, y1), \u2026 (xn, yn). Here, \u2018i\u2019 represents the observation count in the training data (n), yi represents the class of the ith observation (either −1 or 1), and xi represents a set of real-valued values in the D-dimensional space of the ith observation. In Fig.13, the value of the D-dimension is equal to two. Hyperplanes allow for linear separation of the data points. To optimize the margin, the SVM algorithm aims to determine the ideal values of the variables \u2018w\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 by solving the primal optimization problem as defined in Eq. 15. Min w , b , εi w 2 2 + C ∑ i = 1 n εi . (15) Subject to : y i w T . x i + b ≥ 1 − ε i , ∀ i ∈ n , ∀ y i ∈ 1 − 1 , and εi ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ n where, the weight vector is represented by \u2018w\u2019, which is orthogonal to the optimal hyperplane. The bias is denoted by the symbol \u2018b\u2019. The positive-slack variable for observation \u2018i\u2019 is represented by \u2018εi\u2019, and the constant \u2018C' (Box constraint) is determined by the user. The term \u201cmargin violation\u201d refers to the situation where an observation, denoted by a blue circle point in Fig. 13, falls within the margin on the correct side of the hyperplane, with the condition that 0 < εi ≤ 1. For values of \u2018εi >1, the instance \u2018i\u2019 that falls on the other side of the separating hyperplane is considered misclassified. An example of this would be the red circle points shown in Fig. 13. When εi equals zero, it indicates that observation i is correctly classified, as seen by the yellow circle point in Fig. 13. The slack variable can be computed using Eq. 16. (16) ε i = max 0 1 \u2013 y i w T ∗ x i + b The trade-off between margin maximization (regularization term) and minimization of misclassified training examples (loss function term) is determined by the constant C (Box constraint). As the value of \u2018C' increases, the margin with the minimum misclassification becomes narrower. Conversely, if the value of \u2018C' decreases, the margin widens, leading to an increased likelihood of misclassification. To address scenarios in which the observations cannot be linearly separated by hyperplanes, it is possible to modify the kernel scale to obtain the most favorable solution. The \u201ckernel function\u201d for the SVM prediction method is the mathematical function that changes the input variables (predictors) into a higher-dimensional space where the SVM builds a regression model. Some commonly used kernel functions are linear, polynomial, quadratic, Gaussian, and custom kernel functions. The selection of a suited kernel function is of utmost importance to achieve precise and reliable regression models using SVM. Additionally, the kernel scale (k) is a vital hyperparameter that governs the breadth of the kernel function employed for the purpose of mapping the input data into a space of higher dimensions. The complexity and accuracy of SVM-based prediction can be improved using variations in k values according to the available database. Table 5 presents the variations in hyperparameter values for the suggested SVM prediction models, aiming to identify the optimum prediction model. 2.5 Prediction model evaluation and validation The evaluation and validation processes are essential for the development of ML-based prediction models [10]. In this research, these processes are implemented to assure the effectiveness and reliability of proposed prediction model to predict the EC of PCM- integrated building. The prediction model evaluation process was performed using the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), normalized mean bias error (NMBE), performance index (ρ), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and relative root mean square error (RRMSE), presented in Eqs. 17\u201321 [10,61]. (17) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ∣ ai − pi ∣ ∑ i = 1 n ai − p ¯ 2 (18) NMBE = 100 ∙ 1 N ∑ i = 1 n ai − pi a ¯ (19) RRMSE = 1 / ∣ a ¯ ∣ 1 N . ∑ i = 1 n ai − pi 2 (20) CV − RMSE = 100 ∙ 1 N ∑ i = 1 n ai − pi 2 a ¯ (21) ρ = RRMSE 1 + R where \u2018ai\u2019 and \u2018pi\u2019 are the ith actual and predicted output values, a ¯ and p ¯ are the actual and predicted output averages, and \u2018N' is the sample size. Furthermore, the evaluated prediction models of both methods of ML (MEP and SVM) were validated using an external validation process [10,61]. The statistical attributes utilized for the validation process are outlined in Table 6 . This process would establish a more reliable and robust prediction model for the estimation of the EC of PCM-integrated buildings in the BSh climate zone. 2.5.1 Parametric and energy saving analysis for the developed prediction model In this research, a parametric study was done to define the behavior of the most influential parameters (Input variables) in predicting the EC tendencies of PCM-integrated buildings during the early stages of building design. The values of one input variable were varied by keeping all other variables' values constant to observe variations in EC for buildings incorporated with PCM [10]. Eq. 22 was used to calculate the energy savings for PCM-incorporated building based on the optimized values of the most influential EDSPs predicted by the developed prediction model [10]. (22) Energy savings kWh = Building ' s yearly EC without PCM integration \u2013 Building ' s yearly EC with PCM integration 3 Results and discussions The present research's results and discussion part comprehensively analyze and clarify the findings of the research. This research segment is partitioned into multiple subsections, each focusing on the study's distinct facets. In Section 3.1, the results based on multi-stage sensitivity are presented. In Section 3.2, the results of the evaluation and validation of all projected MEP and SVM forecasting models are explained. This section evaluates the most robust MEP and SVM based prediction models for estimating the EC of PCM-integrated buildings in the selected climate zone. Additionally, this section provided the most reliable prediction model obtained from the external validation process. Section 3.3 compares the accuracy of the developed prediction model with conventional linear and non-linear regression analysis. Finally, Section 3.4 provides an examination of the performance of the generated forecasting model through the implementation of parametric and energy-saving analyses specific to the chosen climate zone. 3.1 Results of MSA In the first stage, three global sensitivity analysis methods were employed to assess the impact of EDSPs. Highly influential parameters were recognized based on sensitivity analysis results attained (Table 7 ) from the PRCC, SRRC, and Morris methods. The rankings produced from various methods have been averaged to provide a comprehensive view of parameter relevance. The SRRC and PRCC analyses revealed that RSA, WSA, BO, WinC, RC, PTm, Pt, and RSH were the most influential parameters in the BSh zone. Conversely, the Morris method identified BO, RSA, WSA, PTm, RSH, Pt, and WinC as the parameters with the highest significance. The Morris technique consistently demonstrated stable ranks for RSA, WVT, WSH, WC, BO, and RC across all cities in the BSh zone. The SRRC and PRCC techniques produced consistent parameter rankings for BO in all selected cities, with minor variances in the rankings for other parameters. The ranking of each parameter of the SRRC and PRCC was identical in most cities, while Lahore and Port Elizabeth showed slight variations in parameter rankings. Morris method rankings notably deviated from SRRC and PRCC ranks, indicating different perspectives about parameter relevance. This disparity implies that the Morris technique captures sensitivity features that the other methods do not completely address. As a result, depending entirely on a single sensitivity analysis approach to ensure the identification of every important design parameter is not recommended as it may result in the overlooking of vital parameters. Following this initial ranking, the top eight sensitive parameters specific to the BSh climate zone were identified: WSA, RSA, BO, PTm, WinC, RSH, RC, and Pt. Several studies employed global sensitivity analysis methods to assess the effect of EDSPs on objective functions in residential buildings without PCM. For example, Gou et al. [33] utilized SRRC to determine the most important parameters influencing thermal comfort and EC in a recently constructed residential building in China. The SRRC results highlighted the east wall solar absorptance as a highly significant parameter affecting EC. Similarly, Li et al. [35] examined the influence of various parameters on energy usage and winter discomfort in zero/low energy buildings in China using SRRC. The outcomes demonstrated the significant influence of both roof and wall solar absorptance on energy usage. In addition to SRRC, Bre et al. [62] applied the Morris technique to assess the impact of design parameters on thermal and energy objectives in residential buildings in Argentina. Their research identified window infiltration rate, building azimuth, and outside wall solar absorptance as significant factors in reducing overall energy use. Silva & Ghisi [63] conducted a study on the sensitivity of design factors in low-income buildings, emphasizing energy and thermal performance in Brazil. Utilizing the Morris approach and LSA, they found that, thermal capacity of roof, solar absorptance of wall and roof were the most important parameters impacting on the cooling EC. This finding highlighted the significance of wall and roof solar absorptance in addition to building orientation for residential design sensitivity analyses. LSA was conducted to further assess the significance of the utmost influential parameters identified in the first-stage sensitivity analysis. LSA utilized local sensitivity indices (LSI) to measure the influence of these parameters on TEC in the BSh climatic zone. Results of LSA for these eight EDSPs across six cities are shown in Fig. 14 . Average LSI values derived from data collected across these cities served as a basis for determining the most critical parameters. In general, a larger LSI value indicates a more significant influence of a design parameter on total EC. Notably, the findings remained consistent across all cities. Overall, RSA, WSA, BO, WinC, and PTm emerged as the most influential parameters for assessing TEC in the BSh climate zone, based on the LSI values. In summary, MSA has identified and prioritized key design parameters for residential buildings in the BSh climate zone. These parameters include RSA, WSA, BO, WinC, and PTm. The use of MSA ensures that the refined dataset preserves vital information, enhancing the efficiency of ML model training and prediction. 3.1.1 Analysis of resource utilization during energy evaluations with and without MSA For the comparison of two databases (with and without MSA), a statistical descriptive analysis was conducted to explore the key aspects for gaining insight into the data characteristics (i.e., mean, median, mode, minimum value, maximum value, count, etc.). Also, this comparison has yielded information on the utilization of resources (mainly time) for both databases during the energy evaluations conducted through the energy simulation process. Table 8 and Table 9 display the results of descriptive analysis of EC databased with and without MSA. It is noted that no significant difference in the statistical values of input parameters was found after using MSA when compared to the values without MSA. This confirms the reliable behavior of physical modelling-based energy simulation according to the system's boundary conditions based on its working principle. For example, the values of statistical parameters for BO in both tables (Table 8 and Table 9) are almost similar. Similarly, the other most influential EDSPs (WinC, WSA, RSA, and PTm) have shown similar values for the statistical parameters. However, there is an apparent disparity in the time needed to create the two databases with equal data values for EC during the energy simulation procedure (Fig. 15 ). EC evaluations for the most influential parameters used almost half of the time when compared to the energy evaluations for all EDSPs. Based on the outcomes of this comparison, it is significant to mention that multi-stage analysis can be used to identify the most important independent variables among the several variables to develop a ML model with less complexity and more reliability to predict the dependent variable. 3.1.2 Comparison of the results of MSA with prior research Comparing the findings of this research on the use of MSA with the findings of previous literature is critical to confirming its reliability for producing effective results. Tables 10 and 11 present this comparison. This comparison has demonstrated that the implementation of MSA in this research offers valuable insights into the significant parameters influencing EC in PCM-integrated buildings. Previous researchers have identified various influential parameters such as building orientation, roof and wall solar absorptance, melting temperature of PCM, and window visible transmittance which align with the parameters examined in this research. This alignment indicates that the influential parameters found in this research are in line with the findings of international literature, demonstrating the MSA approach's reliability in identifying crucial design parameters for improving energy efficiency and energy performance in PCM-integrated buildings. 3.2 Data analysis and visualization to confirm the applicability of machine learning methods The process of performing a descriptive statistical analysis on a database entails a systematic investigation and description of the data to obtain a comprehensive understanding of its basic attributes and patterns [10,68]. The created database for the EC in PCM-integrated buildings for the most influential EDSPs through energy simulation was analyzed (Table 9 and Fig. 16 ) to comprehend the fundamental patterns, distributions, and interactions that exist within it. This study offers a detailed examination of the central tendencies of the dataset, comprising measures such as the mean, median, and mode. These measures are helpful in gaining insight into the typical values within the dataset [10]. Table 9 displays the mean, median, and mode values for all independent (input) and dependent (output) variables of the EC database. It can be clearly seen that for any specific input parameter, the values for mean, median, and mode are close to each other, indicating a symmetric distribution of data values. For example, the mean value of BO is 180.33, with a median of 180 and a mode of 210 (Table 9), suggesting a symmetrical distribution of data values. Further, metrics of dispersion, such as standard deviation, serve to emphasize the extent to which data points deviate from the mean values. Table 9 shows that the standard deviation values for all input variables are less than their mean values, which shows that the data points or data values are close to their mean values, indicating less variability and dispersion among their data values. Like, the standard deviation of BO (Table 9) is smaller than its mean, suggesting that the data points are closely clustered around the mean. Additionally, skewness measures the extent of asymmetry around the mean in a variable's data values. Variables can demonstrate positive, zero, negative, or infinite skewness values that can be used to develop prediction models using ML techniques [10]. Table 9 shows that the skewness values for all variables are according to the values defined by [10] to create a prediction model that employs ML methods. Brown and Greene [69] asserted that the kurtosis-value accurately signifies the shape of the normal distribution for a variable, falling within the range of −10 to +10. The kurtosis values of all input and output variables (Table 9) fell within the range defined by Brown and Greene [69]. Through a comprehensive investigation of the dataset's attributes, patterns, and distributions, this research confirms the employment of ML methods to formulate several EC estimation models for buildings with PCM integration with the most influential EDSPs in the BSh climate zone. To validate the suitability of ML methods for constructing the most reliable prediction model in this study, the correlation matrix plot is depicted in Fig. 16. The correlation matrix provides significant importance in the use of ML methods for the formulation of predictive models. This analysis offers an in-depth understanding of the interconnections among variables within a given dataset, hence directly influencing the efficacy and interpretability of the model. Highly correlated variables can indicate the existence of multicollinearity, which has the potential to undermine the stability and dependability of the predictive model. However, slightly correlated variables reduce the issues related to multicollinearity in ML-based prediction models, which indicates the application of advanced non-linear regression-based ML methods to formulate the prediction models. The correlation coefficient (r) varies from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 specifies no correlation and a value of ±1 indicates a strong correlation. Strong positive linear relationships between two variables are indicated by a high positive value of r, and strong negative linear relationships are indicated by a high negative value of \u2018r' [10]. Consequently, Fig. 16 provides lower values of \u2018r' for all variables to confirm the applicability of advanced nonlinear regression-based ML methods for the formulation of predictive models with high accuracy. As we can see, the r value between BO (input variable) and EC (output variable) is −0.003, which is very low to depict the non-linear relationship between each other. Like all other input variables, the r value shows similar behavior to the output variable. As a result, the utilization of respective artificial intelligence (AI)-based ML methods has the potential to develop a best-performing predictive model based on the results of \u2018r' for the given input and output variables in this research [10,70]. This research utilizes data analysis to identify the most appropriate ML-based method for predicting EC in PCM-integrated buildings. For this purpose, the research presents MEP and SVM methods to formulate prediction models. 3.3 Prediction models evaluation and validation 3.3.1 MEP models evaluation The MEP approach involves the evolution and combination of various mathematical expressions to generate a solution for a given problem. The assessment of MEP-based prediction models decides significant importance in evaluating the efficacy and reliability of the MEP models throughout the evaluation process. The results of the evaluation for all proposed MEP-based prediction models are presented in Table 12 . For the testing and training phase, MEP15 has shown better performance (Table 12) in terms of evaluated statistical parameters contrasted with other models to predict the energy use of PCM incorporated building. The values for the model evaluation metric are well within the tolerable range [10] showing the robustness of prediction model. The performance accuracy of the evaluated MEP-based prediction model (MEP15) is represented by an absolute error plot (Fig.17 (a)). It helps to visualize the relationship between the predicted and the actual values. Fig. 17 (a) presents both negative and positive values for error in the developed prediction model, which indicates acceptable reliability to predict EC contrasted with each proposed MEP-based predictive models. ML-based forecasting models are expected to exhibit a tendency to anticipate values with minimal positive and negative error to avoid displaying optimistic or pessimistic behavior during their development phase. The tendencies of the evaluated model (MEP15) for absolute errors depict that the model predicts a higher value than the actual value with positive error and a lower value than the actual value with negative error, which is the required behavior of the prediction model according to [10]. The absolute error of MEP15 represented by MAPE (2.902% in Table 12) confirms the accuracy of this model. Further, the linear fit plot (Fig. 17(b)) for the evaluated MEP15 represents the performance alignment of this model with regression linear fit, indicating how much the model is aligned to evaluate the EC of PCM-integrated building. According to Fig. 17(b), the model fit is close to the ideal fit, which confirms the robustness of the MEP15 estimation model to forecast the EC of PCM-incorporated building. Furthermore, the accuracy of MEP15 was tested by the error distribution plot (Fig. 17(c)). For the majority of the data counts, the distribution of error is close to zero confirming the consistency of the evaluated MEP based prediction model. 3.3.2 SVM models evaluation The proposed SVM-based forecasting models were assessed utilizing several statistical evaluation metrics. The results of model assessment for all proposed SVM prediction models are presented in Table 13 . The model evaluation process depicted that the SVM12 was the most reliable prediction model among all other proposed SVM-based prediction models. A graphical representation of the evaluated SVM-based prediction model's performance accuracy is provided by an absolute error plot (Fig. 18(a)). The correlation between predictions and actual results can be perceived more clearly in this manner. The analysis of the SVM12 model's tendencies for absolute errors reveals that the model consistently predicts values higher than the actual values when there is a positive error, and lower than the actual values when there is a negative error. This aligns with the desired behavior of the prediction model, as stated in reference [10]. The MAPE (Table 13) demonstrates that the absolute error of SVM12 validates the precision of this model in comparison to other SVM based prediction models, with a value of 11.907%. Additionally, the figure depicting the linear fit plot for the SVM12 prediction model illustrates the degree to which this model aligns with regression linear fit. This relationship serves as a sign of the model's capability to accurately forecast the EC of buildings integrated with PCM. Fig. 18(b) shows that the model fit is not nearby enough to the ideal fit as MEP15 (Fig. 18(b)), which confirms the lower accuracy of the SVM12 forecasting model to forecast the energy use of PCM-integrated building as compared the accuracy of MEP15 prediction model. Also, the accuracy of SVM12 was evaluated through the utilization of an error distribution plot, as illustrated in Fig. 18(c). For most of the data counts, the distribution of error is close to zero confirming the reliability of the evaluated SVM based prediction model. 3.3.3 Comparison of evaluated prediction models A comparison between evaluated prediction models entails a systematic assessment of the most accurate prediction models based on MEP and SVM. This comparison is conducted among the evaluated prediction models (MEP15 and SVM12) to ascertain their efficacy and suitability for forecasting the EC of PCM-integrated building in BSh climate, considering the most influential EDSPs. The results of comparison in terms of R2 are presented in Fig. 19(a). It indicates that the MEP15 model has superior accuracy and robustness in predicting the EC of building integrated with PCM. Also, the results of the comparison in terms of CV-RMSE and ρ (Fig. 19(b and c) show that these values for the MEP15 are lower than SVM12, which confirms the accuracy of the MEP15 prediction model in the training and testing phase. The evaluation of the performance and prediction capability of the MEP15 prediction model is conducted through a comparison with basic linear and non-linear regression models. The comparison presented in Table 14 emphasizes the model's ability to reliably predict the EC of a PCM-integrated building. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed prediction model outperformed that of the simple linear and non-linear regression models in predicting the EC of PCM-integrated buildings. This was evident through higher values of R2 and lower values of NMBE, CV-RMSE, and ρ. Fig. 20 presents the comparison of time required for both training and testing phases of the MEP-based and SVM-based best-performing prediction models among the other proposed prediction models. The MEP15 model has used more time for both phases when compared to SVM12. However, this time was much less than the time required to evaluate the energy performance of PCM-integrated building (Fig. 15) through energy simulations. 3.3.4 External validation An assessed forecasting model's accuracy and reliability ought to be confirmed by external validation. In this context, Table 15 displays the results of external validation process for the most reliable MEP-based prediction model. It can be clearly seen that the MEP15 (Table 13), the most robust prediction after the evaluation process, has shown the values of external validation parameters well within the defined ranges. This process confirmed the precision and consistency of MEP15 forecasting model to predict the EC of PCM-integrated building, considering the most influential EDSPs determined from MSA. Eq. 23 presents the mathematical expression for the developed MEP15 prediction model to predict EC, which is created based on the trained MEP15 prediction model by the MEPX tool. This equation can be used reliably to calculate the EC of PCM-integrated buildings, considering any value of the most influential EDSPs from their defined ranges mention in this research. (23) EC \u2032 = 0.25 BO + 2WinC + 2WSA + 8RSA + 2PTm + 2 WSA × RSA + 3 √ RSA + WinC WSA + 1 RSA + 30.5 Based on the model evaluation and validation process for the all-formulated prediction models, the MEP-based prediction model can provide the most accurate results of EC prediction for selected building in the BSh climate, consuming less resources. 3.3.5 Assessment of the established forecasting model with prior research The outcomes of this research were compared with the available literature about the application of ML methods to evaluate the performance of buildings with and without PCM integration. Table 16 displays this comparison, affirming the reliability and robustness of the MEP15 prediction model in forecasting the EC of PCM-incorporated buildings within the chosen climate zone, achieving an R2 value exceeding 95%. 3.4 Parametric and energy saving analysis of developed prediction model The behavior of the developed estimation model to forecast the EC of PCM-integrated building was depicted by the parametric analysis, and then the potential of this model for energy savings was evaluated. Fig. 21 (a-e) shows the outcomes of the parametric study of the established predictive model. It shows how changes in the values for each of the most influential independent (EDSPs) variables affect the dependent (EC) variable. It is clear that the considered EDSPs have non-linear influences (Fig. 21(a-e)) on the prediction for EC of PCM-integrated building. The detailed results of the parametric analysis are presented in the following subsections. 3.4.1 Building orientation The variations in building orientation have shown (Fig. 21(a)) an irregular pattern in the EC of PCM-integrated building. EC has shown both increasing and decreasing trends for the different building orientations. Generally, this behavior of EC in buildings incorporated with PCM due to the variations in building orientation has been observed by several researchers [10,64,71]. For example, Delgarm et al. [64] evaluated the influence of building orientation (BO) on the energy efficiency of buildings across various climates in Iran. They observed that the building orientation significantly affects the ability to predict the annual EC of buildings integrated with PCM. 3.4.2 Window conductivity Fig. 16(b) depicts the relationship between window conductivity and the predicted EC of the developed prediction model. The building's EC increased non-linearly as the window conductivity increased. In general, the increase in window conductivity allows more heat transfer, which results in more EC to maintain the comfort level of buildings [72]. Nazir et al. [10] assessed the influence of window conductivity along with other window characteristics on the EC of a residential building through a parametric study for developed prediction model in their study. They found that the annual EC of the selected building model increased with the increase in window conductivity for the selected climate zone. 3.4.3 Wall and roof solar absorptance The relationship between wall and roof solar absorption and predicted EC of PCM-integrated building is presented in Fig. 21(c&d). The non-linear increasing trend in the predicted EC for buildings due to the increase in wall and roof solar absorption confirms the model's behavior according to the physical conditions of the system [73]. During the evaluation of building performance in the particular climate zone, variations in EC reveal that the solar absorption by the walls and roof could be impacted by several factors, such as increased heat gain, decreased thermal comfort, increased cooling loads, etc. A research team [10] predicted the energy use of PCM-incorporated building in the tropical savanna climate, which has proximity to the climatic conditions as the selected climate zone (BSh) in this research. From parametric analysis, it was found that the increase in wall solar absorption increases the energy use of PCM-incorporated buildings. Yao and Yan [74] have shown that variations in wall solar absorption affect the EC of buildings in Ningbo City, China. Their study observed that the rise in wall solar absorption led to an increase in the building's EC for cooling. 3.4.4 Melting temperature of PCM The correlation between PCM's melting temperature and the EC of buildings could provide insight into the significance of PCM integration. Fig. 21(e) depicts the behavior of PCM's melting temperature variations on the rate of EC by the selected building. The optimal PCM for the selected climate is found to be 28 °C, which is aligned with the findings of Abilkhassenova et al. [75]. The generic behavior of PCM-integrated buildings against variations in the melting temperature of PCM was also investigated by Kishore et al. [66]. They conducted the parametric analysis for the PCM-integrated wall of the building for optimal modulation of thermal load in lightweight buildings. This analysis showed that the PCM with a phase change temperature of 24\u201325 °C has shown maximum thermal load modulation. Overall, the parametric analysis has demonstrated that the MEP predictive model (MEP15) accurately reflects the system's actual boundary conditions. The findings of the energy savings analysis are presented in Table 14. Maximum energy savings in PCM-integrated buildings were obtained by the developed prediction model at the optimized values of the most influential EDSPs, which were up to 12% (Table 17 ). Also, this analysis confirms the optimized PCM with a melting temperature of 28 °C for the BSh climate zone, as it was observed during the parametric analysis (Fig. 21) of the developed prediction model. 4 Conclusions, limitations, and recommendations Accurate prediction of EC in buildings is essential for optimizing energy usage, enhancing efficiency, and mitigating environmental impact. In this context, developing a ML prediction model that focuses solely on the most influential building design parameters results in a reduced model's training time and complexity for the understanding of hidden relationships between independent and dependent variables. Based on the clear gaps in knowledge, this research provides a novel framework to develop a robust machine-learning-based prediction model for the estimation of EC of PCM-integrated building utilizing the results of multi-stage sensitivity analysis for the most influential building's EDSPs. The MSA aims to identify the most influential EDSPs for assessing EC in PCM-integrated buildings. MSA, which consists of both global (Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient, Standardized Rank Regression Coefficients, and the Morris methods of sensitivity analysis) and local sensitivity analysis, was applied to determine the most influential building design parameters. The following important conclusions were drawn from the research: \u2022 MSA has identified building orientation, roof solar absorptance, wall solar absorptance, window conductivity, and melting temperature of the PCM as the most influential EDSPs. Utilizing these parameters, a significant reduction in time utilization (approximately 50%) was reported for the energy evaluation process based on physical modelling; \u2022 Based on the model evaluation and validation process for the formulated MEP and SVM-based prediction models, considering the EC database for the most influential parameters, it was found that the MEP-based prediction model (MEP15) was the most reliable and robust prediction model, having an R2 value >95% and an NMBE value <5% for both the training and testing phases compared to all other formulated prediction models in this research. \u2022 The ML-based forecasting model (MEP15) utilized less time during the model development process with the provision of an evolutionary mathematical expression when compared with the time utilized for the energy simulation process and the prediction model training process; \u2022 Parametric analysis confirmed that the EC model behavior was as per the system's physical boundary conditions. \u2022 Energy-saving analysis provided an optimized PCM with a melting temperature of 28 °C and reduced EC in buildings by up to 12%. 4.1 Limitations and recommendations \u2022 The study focuses primarily on mid-rise apartment buildings, limiting the generalizability of the results to this particular building type. Therefore, it is suggested that in the future, more building models should be incorporated to develop a reliable machine-learning prediction model. The proposed framework can be used for different climate zones according to the characteristics of the available database of EC of PCM-integrated buildings for both current and future climate scenarios; \u2022 The generalizability of the machine-learning prediction model can be affected during the model training process, considering that the EC database only contains the early-stage building design parameters for the application of MSA, excluding the environmental parameters, occupancy schedules, HVAC systems, changes in the thermophysical properties of PCM (latent heat, thermal conductivity, and density), human behavior, etc. Therefore, it is suggested that these parameters should be considered to develop a more generalized machine-learning-based prediction model with higher accuracy. \u2022 The input parameter uncertainties are not taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis. Uncertainties are common in real-world data, and alterations in these factors might impact their findings. Further research should include uncertainty analysis to account for differences in input parameters. This approach would enhance the robustness of the sensitivity analysis, offering more reliable and realistic insights that can better inform decision-making in practical applications.

        "dc:description": "Accurate machine learning (ML) predictions for the early stages of the building design are crucial to construct energy-efficient buildings utilizing limited resources. Several studies have employed ML methods for energy consumption (EC) prediction without considering the utmost crucial PCM-integrated building design parameters. In addition, reducing the dataset by considering only the most significant building design parameters before applying the ML-based method would be beneficial for reducing the computational power and memory usage of the system as well as utilizing less time in the modelling process. To this end, this research presents a novel framework to establish the most robust and reliable ML-based prediction model with less complexity, considering only the most influential PCM-integrated building design parameters. These parameters were identified for future scenarios of hot semi-arid (BSh) climate zones using multi-stage sensitivity analysis. Afterward, a reduced EC database based on the most significant building's early-design-stage parameters (EDSPs) was utilized to formulate several multi-expression programming (MEP) and support vector machines (SVM)-based forecasting models, considering the variations in their hyperparameter values. Formulated prediction models have shown less time utilization through the training and testing phases for the EC evaluations of selected PCM-integrated building compared to the physical-modelling process. Several statistical parameters were used to test and validate the performance of the formulated prediction models. The acquired model evaluation and validation results demonstrated that the MEP-based prediction model (MEP15) exhibited the highest level of reliability and accuracy, showing an R2 value of >95% for both the training and testing phases. The model's interpretability showed that, throughout the parametric analysis, the developed prediction model adhered to the system's physical boundary constraints. Also, the best-performing prediction model showed energy savings of up to 12% for building integrated with PCM having a melting temperature of 28 °C. Conclusively, this research demonstrated that the developed MEP-based prediction model could be employed to precisely forecast the EC for selected PCM-incorporated building in the whole BSh climate, considering important EDSPs while utilizing minimal resources.",
