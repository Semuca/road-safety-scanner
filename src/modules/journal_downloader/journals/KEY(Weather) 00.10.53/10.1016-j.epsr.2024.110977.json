In response to the characteristics of multiple loads coupled within integrated energy systems, strong seasonality, and pronounced short-term repetitive patterns, this study proposes a method for identifying key meteorological features based on ADF and TE and an improved IES short-term multi-energy load joint prediction method using Skip-LSTM. Initially, the stability of seasonal loads is considered to determine typical load coupling patterns over extended periods, with key meteorological factors affecting load fluctuations extracted using the TE algorithm. Subsequently, short-term load curve repetitive patterns are obtained under different coupling modes utilizing autocorrelation functions. Finally, key meteorological factors and load values are separately input into the proposed MTL-Skip LSTM-Attention model for different coupling modes. The model employs a feature attention mechanism to weigh the influence of meteorological factors, constructs stacked LSTMs to extract deep-state representations of weighted sequences, enables Skip-LSTM to capture long-cycle curve repetitive patterns, and incorporates a linear layer to fuse feature values at different skip intervals for prediction. Testing of the proposed model under mode-1 in real-world scenarios reveals a reduction in MAPE errors for electricity-cooling-heating predictions by 15.6 %, 52.7 %, and 4.7 % respectively, compared with the traditional attention-LSTM model, thus validating the superiority of the proposed approach.

In contrast to large-scale thermal power generation units, integrated energy systems leverage electric-cold-heat energy conversion devices to achieve cascading utilization of diverse energy qualities, thereby altering the status quo of independent operation among electricity, gas, and heat networks and ameliorating environmental pollution concerns [1]. On the other hand, while integrated energy systems [2,3] offer greater flexibility and lower carbon emissions compared to traditional thermal power units, multi-energy coupling and parallel output mechanisms [4] introduce nonlinear characteristics and intricate internal operational dynamics, significantly augmenting the challenges in system control. Accurate short-term load forecasting serves as a prerequisite for the stable operation of these systems, furnishing reliable data services essential for system flexibility scheduling and disaster risk forecasting [5]. Research on load forecasting methods tailored to integrated energy systems has significant implications and relevance. 1.2 Literature review Accurate load forecasting is the cornerstone for ensuring the reliable operation and economic regulation of systems. Although existing forecasting methods predominantly address the prediction of individual electrical loads, they hold valuable insights for the load forecasting of integrated energy systems. Forecasting methods can be broadly categorized into statistical modeling approaches, exemplified by sequence regression analysis [6], and data-driven methods, represented by deep learning. Traditional methods include regression analysis [7,8], exponential smoothing [9], and refined models [10]. Traditional statistical models are characterized by their simplicity in construction and rapid model training speed; however, their limited ability to extract nonlinear features renders them unsuitable for contemporary power system load forecasting. Owing to advancements in hardware and the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, neural networks, exemplified by LSTM, LSTM-Skip, and others [11], establish mapping relationships from shallow to deep intermediate states through network structure design, significantly enhancing their capability to capture nonlinear load features and temporal dependencies [12]. The consumption fluctuations in cold, heat, and electrical loads exhibit similarities, influenced by user behavior and meteorological changes, thus possessing temporal and seasonal characteristics. Furthermore, neural network models can adaptively train iteratively through supervised learning, avoiding the cumbersome parameter-search process. Intelligent prediction methods based on neural networks are gradually becoming a focal point in load forecasting research within IES. Currently, network forecasting methods for IES can be categorized into two main types: single prediction [13] and multivariate prediction [14]. A Single prediction involves selecting a specific type of load within the system as the prediction target while incorporating other features as auxiliary variables into the model. However, this approach has been less explored for forecasting multi-energy loads within comprehensive energy systems. For instance, in [15], the authors decomposed load curves into high and low-frequency components using wavelet transformation and achieved promising results by classifying and predicting different frequency sequences. Nevertheless, the wavelet decomposition process for multiclass loads tends to be complex and disrupts the original energy coupling relationships. In [16], a single-load prediction method based on copula theory and improved LSTM was proposed. This method utilizes Copula functions to measure the coupling relationships between loads and employs stacked LSTM to extract deep features of the loads. However, the proposed model being single-targeted may lead to low parameter utilization in the input model. Compared to single-energy system forecasting, capturing the coupling relationships of multi-class loads is crucial for improving the accuracy of load forecasting in integrated energy systems;Multivariate load prediction, on the other hand, integrates predictive models with multi-task learning [17], where multiple load consumption levels are targeted for prediction simultaneously. This approach explores and shares parameters and mapping relationships of multiple input features, yielding multiple associated prediction task outcomes. Many scholars have conducted multifaceted analyses and applied multitask learning to simulate electric, cooling, and heating interconnections in comprehensive energy systems. In [18], periodic relationships and coupling effects were considered, and external features were shared using a joint input method. Three attention modules were introduced to allocate numerical weights for the CNN-GRU model's medium and short-term hidden states, enhancing its ability to capture coupling information across multiple time scales. In [19], a CNN-Seq2Seq prediction model was proposed for multi-energy load prediction in IES. By concatenating data with hard-weighted sharing, the model extracts coupling relationships. However, considering CNN's limitations in extracting time-series features, an encoder-decoder structure with LSTM was employed to capture intermediate temporal information and achieve multi-energy load prediction. Using campus load data as samples,[20] conducted feature mining on load data from different buildings based of federated learning. Sub-models were used to extract local data patterns and input them into a central model to explore the coupling relationships of building loads, effectively safeguarding data privacy. In [21], the PCC method was employed to quantitatively analyze the correlations between different energy consumption loads. Input features were visualized through multi-dimensional phase space reconstruction to enhance the data quality of the input prediction model. In [22], a Transform-based encoder-decoder multi-energy prediction model was proposed. Three encoders were used to explore the intermediate states of multi-class load data, and the decoder extracted coupling relationships by sharing parameters, significantly improving data utilization. However, bulky data awaiting decoding pose challenges. The above literature indicates that designing models using the multi-task learning concept can effectively simulate coupling effects between multiple loads, thereby enhancing the accuracy of load forecasting in IES.

In this regard, a pixel-reconstruction based data reconstruction technique has been proposed [24], wherein multi-energy load data are decomposed into three-dimensional pixel matrices for three-dimensional differential processing. This technique considers the multidimensional data correlations for reconstruction fusion, thereby visualizing data features. Additionally, in reference [25], relationship between regional load total consumption and coupled grid total demand is investigated. Through participant and multi-energy coupling mode analysis, key influencing factors of loads are identified, enriching input features. Furthermore, reference [26] extracts critical factors of load fluctuations within the context of deep load coupling. Based on energy supply and demand, key load coupling scenarios are further extracted, enhancing the interpretability of input features. Finally, reference [27] compares various feature extraction methods for regional thermal load prediction and validates the effectiveness of periodic patterns in thermal load prediction. By incorporating past data with evident periodicity, such as daily and weekly cycles, into thermal load prediction, the forecasting accuracy is significantly improved. Currently, industrial energy systems are primarily deployed in industrial parks or campuses, exhibiting relatively regular patterns of energy usage with minimal influence from social and economic factors, but significant impacts from seasonal variations. This situation makes meteorological factors the primary drivers of load-consumption fluctuations and coupling patterns. Considering environmental factors, coupling relationships, and cyclical patterns can enhance the accuracy of load forecasting in industrial energy systems, particularly given substantial consumption disparities among different types of industrial energy systems [20]. However, deficiencies persist among scholars in modeling and analysis methods. For instance, while references [18,19,22] considered inter-load coupling effects, they fail to extract specific characteristic data. References [26,21] adopted single-output modeling approaches for load coupling effects, neglecting interconnections among different load cycles. Current methods in feature engineering [23,24] only consider correlations and cannot uncover constraint relationships among influencing factors, such as the restrictive impact of meteorological features on load consumption. Different time scales exhibit varying consumption relationships, underscoring the necessity to explore various load-energy connections and long-term changes in numerical models when designing predictive models. This study analyzes the patterns of industrial energy system load variations from both a seasonal long-term perspective and a cyclical short-term perspective to advance predictive model design. 1.3 Contribution (1) A novel approach is proposed that integrates stationarity testing with TE analysis, to examine the coupling patterns among loads and the varying impacts of meteorological factors. (2) Considering the repetitive cycles of load consumption, this study employs autocorrelation strength to simulate users' energy usage inertia, thereby providing a basis for neural networks to capture long-term dependencies among loads. (3) (3)A multi-Skip LSTM-attention model is proposed for load forecasting, wherein a feature attention mechanism is employed to weigh the influence of key meteorological features on load fluctuations. Leveraging LSTM and Skip-LSTM, the model addresses the challenge of capturing load characteristics at different intervals, culminating in the fusion of skip output values through dual fully connected layers. 1.4 Organization Structure The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the forecasting background and the necessary feature analysis methods and the conclusions. The Section 3 introduces the prediction process, the applied model components and the final network model. In Section 4, an example simulation is carried out, and the proposed model is tested using the actual system data set, and compared with other models. The final conclusion is given in Section 5. 2 Problem introduction and feature engineering When addressing the predictive challenges of multiple energy loads in IES, this issue can be metaphorically described as constructing a predictive model capable of identifying consumption patterns of multiple energy loads within the system, thereby achieving the function of forecasting electricity, cooling, and heating load consumption within a certain time interval. The prediction error metric reflects the performance of the proposed predictive model. Optimal prediction accuracy is attained by minimizing the difference between actual and predicted consumption across these three loads. The relationship between load consumption and error metrics can be illustrated using Eq. (1\u20132). (1) Y total = Y e l e + Y c o o l + Y t h e r m a l (2) L l o s s = f ( y e l e − y \u203e e l e ) + f ( y c o o l − y \u203e c o o l ) + f ( y t h e r m a l − y \u203e t h e r m a l ) Where: y e l e , y c o o l , y t h e r m a l is the Load consumption, y \u203e e l e , y \u203e c o o l , y \u203e t h e r m a l is the Load forecast consumption. Fig. 1 shows the energy flow pathways within a typical integrated energy system, wherein energy is supplied from the left-hand side gas and electricity networks into the system. Within the IES, energy cogeneration units, energy storage systems, and cooling apparatuses are internally embedded to facilitate the optimal coupling, transformation, and redistribution of energy. These flows traverse the laid-out conduits and thermal pipes to cater to user-side consumption. This study, utilizing the Arizona State University campus integrated energy system as a real-life exemplar, focuses on the fluctuation patterns of load curves during the years 2020-2021. The investigation encompasses 288 buildings and the energy consumption of 50,246 students enrolled in the Tempe campus, encompassing electricity, cooling, and heating energies as its research subjects. 2.1 Analysis of coupling modes As a typical campus integrated energy system, the influence of socio-economic and energy price fluctuations on load consumption can be disregarded, with load consumption fluctuations primarily driven by meteorological conditions. Situated within the distinctly seasonal subtropical desert climate zone, the campus IES exhibits discernible bimodal and bimodal high characteristics in its consumption curves, as shown in Fig. 2 , indicating peaks in cooling demand during summer and heating demand during winter. Over a long-term temporal scale, the annual load curves manifest two prominent coupling dominant modes. During the scorching summer, the electricity and cooling load curves are notably more active, accounting for the majority of system energy consumption, whereas in the frigid winter, heating and electricity loads dominate energy consumption. The pronounced climatic variations between summer and winter result in significant disparities in user energy consumption patterns, consequently altering the coupling relationships between loads. Therefore, it can be concluded that when the meteorological conditions are relatively stable, the load curve will not show obvious trend change, but only fluctuates within a certain value range with user activities. This kind of series with stable fluctuations without trend changes satisfies the Eq. (3\u20134) and is called wide stationary series. In order to explore the range of the wide stationary load curve and extract the key meteorological factors causing the instability of the series, the load series was first tested by ADF [27] to distinguish the coupling modes. ADF test satisfies Eq. (5), when the load sequence is wide stationarity, there is a unit root, that is, the curve does not change . (3) t ∈ T , E ( x t 2 ) < ∝ , E ( x t ) = C (4) t , s , k ∈ T , k + s − t ∈ T , γ ( t , s ) = γ ( k , k + s − t ) (5) X t = ρ X t − 1 + ∑ j = 1 p α j , p ▵ X t − j + e t , p Where: x t is the load value, C is constant, p is the model order, Generally, the second-order stable sequence is called wide-stationary sequence. Based on the wide stationarity detected, the thermal load curve exhibits wide stationarity from April to September, while the cooling load curve shows stationarity from October to March of the following year. The electrical load consistently displays a changing trend. Therefore, April to September of each year is defined as Mode 1, and October to March of the following year is defined as Mode 2. Subsequently, key meteorological factors and repetitive cycles are identified further within these two distinct coupling patterns of loads. After the division of coupling models, the meteorological factors causing load fluctuations are confined to different intervals, and then the causal relationship between meteorological factors and load characteristics can be quantitatively analyzed by using TE [28]. TE is a qualitative method for determining causality, which can analyze the contribution of one series data to another series data by using historical data without exposing future data shown in Eq. (6\u20138). The Table 1 and Table 2 shows the causal values of meteorological factors and load values under different models. (6) h ( x a ) = − ∑ t p ( x a , t , x a , t − 1 r ) log p ( x a , t | x a , t r ) (7) h ( x a | x b ) = − ∑ t p ( x a , t , x a , t − 1 r , x b , t s ) log p ( x a , t | x a , t r , x b , t s ) (8) T E = h ( x a | x b ) − h ( x a ) Where: x t − i is load data. h ( x a ) and h ( x a | x b ) are the entropy rate calculated; x a , t r = { x a , i , x a , i + 1 , . . . , x a , i − 1 } and x b , s r = { x a , i , x a , i + 1 , ⋯ , x a , s − 1 , } are the characteristic historical data. T E is the amount of information transferred. Using the transfer entropy algorithm, contributions of various meteorological features to load characteristics are computed separately under different coupling modes. Tables 1 and 2 respectively present the contributions of meteorological factors to load values in Mode 1 and Mode 2 coupling relationships. To avoid input feature redundancy, only the top three meteorological features with significant weights are selected for input into the prediction model. 2.2 Analysis of the repeat cycle For short-term load forecasting, the continuity of user energy activities implies that load values over consecutive days contain valuable implicit information. Analysis of the multi-energy load curves in Fig. 3 over a continuous week in Mode 1 reveals that minimal heat demand results in a stationary thermal load curve without trend changes. Conversely, electrical and cooling load demands, which are larger, exhibit temporal variations based on campus user activities. This indicates a significant correlation between energy consumption and user activities, leading to pronounced autocorrelation in the load curves. The energy consumption displays distinct repetitive patterns and sequential relationships. Repetitive patterns refer to similar load consumption at the same time points over adjacent days. Sequential relationships describe interdependencies among various energy usage habits; for instance, an increase in cooling load consumption during summer typically coincides with an increase in electrical load consumption, indicating temporal succession and coupling. In order to further explore the relationship between load repetition period and energy consumption by Eq. (9), the Fig. 4 shows the autocorrelation coefficient of electric-cold-heat load after a delay of a certain time. The setting of the delay time refers to the user's activity habits with a period of 24h, and the peak value in the figure is the number of delay hours when the autocorrelation is maximum. It is obvious that all kinds of load curves have obvious repetition cycles with time intervals of 24h and its multiples. (9) f A C F = 1 n ∑ t = 1 n − k ( x t − x \u203e ) ( x t + k − x \u203e ) / 1 n ∑ t = 1 n ( x t − x \u203e ) 2 Where X t is the load sequence value, n is the time length of the sequence, and k is the autocorrelation delay time. 3 IES Mul-loads forecasting method The forecasting approach, as illustrated in Fig. 5 , begins with preprocessing and correction of missing and outlier data using imputation methods. Subsequently, in the feature engineering stage, coupling intervals are delineated based on the stationarity of sequences. Within different coupling intervals, critical meteorological factors and the model's self-repeating jump lengths are identified using transfer entropy and autocorrelation algorithms, respectively. Finally, these inputs are fed into the multi-load joint prediction model proposed in this study's multitask framework to accomplish load forecasting for IES. 3.1 Data preprocessing The restoration of missing loads data and the normalization of all data were completed using Eq. (10\u201311). (10) x t = x t − 1 + x t − 2 + x t − 3 + x t + 1 + x t + 2 + x t + 3 6 (11) x n o r m = x − x min x max − x min Where: x t is the value after repair; x t − i ( i = 1 , 2 . , 3 . . . 6 ) is the value near the missing data; x n o r m is the normalized value; x is the value to be normalized; x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the data respectively. 3.1.1 Multi-task learning framework Multi-task learning is a classical information induction and transfer application mechanism. Its function is to summarize hidden information extracted from multiple subtasks to realize efficient information sharing. The sharing mechanism can effectively excavate the correlation between multiple load forecasting tasks, and provide a technical path for load forecasting of coupled energy supply systems. In campus IES, there are heat pumps that convert electricity into heat and cogeneration devices that convert natural gas into electricity and heat. A large amount of conversion coupling information is hidden in multi-medium load consumption, and multi-task learning effectively integrates common data of various energy conversion processes. Its structure mechanism is shown in the Fig. 6 . 3.1.2 Characteristic attention mechanism To accurately quantify the varying impacts of key meteorological factors on load at different times, a feature attention mechanism is employed to derive the weights of these influences, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Initially, critical meteorological factors are input into a MLP for weight quantification. Subsequently, the resulting weights from the MLP are normalized using the SoftMax function. Finally, these normalized weights are overlaid as a matrix onto the corresponding load values at each time, representing the respective impacts of meteorological factors. Suppose the input of each meteorological factor is Z N = [ z 1 , z 2 , . . . , z n ] T , then the two-dimensional matrix formed when a total of i meteorological factors are input is shown in the Eq. (12). (12) Z N = [ z 1 ( 1 ) z 1 ( 2 ) · · · z 1 ( i ) z 2 ( 1 ) z 2 ( 2 ) · · · z 2 ( i ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ z n ( 1 ) z n ( 2 ) · · · z n ( i ) ] The key meteorological data is quantified by multi-layer perceptron, and the weights of each part at the current time are calculated by the Eq(13\u201314), and then normalized by SoftMax function, V e , W e , U e are the neuron weight output by the multilayer machine, and b e is the bias parameter. (13) e n i = V e n tanh ( W e h n − 1 + U e z n i + b e ) (14) α n ( i ) = s o f t max ( e n ( i ) ) exp ( e n ( i ) ) ∑ n = 1 i exp ( e n ( i ) ) The weight α n ( i ) obtained by the characteristic attention mechanism is multiplied with the historical load data of the sampling point at the corresponding time to obtain the correlation characteristics X N = [ X 1 , X 2 , ⋯ , X n ] T considering different meteorological factors, As shown in Eq (15). x n is the historical load value of the NTH sampling point, and α n i x n is the load value weighted by meteorological characteristics. (15) X N = [ α 1 1 x 1 α 1 2 x 1 · · · α 1 i x 1 α 2 1 x 2 α 2 2 x 2 · · · α 2 i x 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ α n 1 x n α n 2 x n · · · α n i x n ] 3.1.3 LSTM & Skip-LSTM LSTM is a type of neural network which is composed of forgetting gate, input gate and output gate shown in Fig. 8 and has strong feature extraction ability for time series by Eq (16\u201319). The timing information of the input neural unit can be extracted to the intermediate state and the high-value information can be retained as the sequence propagates downward to realize the extraction of deep features of continuous time series. The gating design of LSTM can effectively avoid the problem of \"gradient explosion\" and \"gradient disappearance\" of information over a long timescale. (16) f t = σ ( w f ⋅ [ h t − 1 , x t ] + b f ) (17) i t = σ ( w i ⋅ [ h t − 1 , x t ] + b i ) (18) C t = tanh ( w c ⋅ [ h t − 1 , x t ] + b c ) (19) o t = σ ( w o ⋅ [ h t − 1 , x t ] + b o ) In addition, autocorrelation analysis showed that the multiple load consumption of IES also had obvious repeating cycles. The load values of the neighboring multiple cycles are highly correlated at the same time and have a great influence on the predicted value. In the LSTM sequence, the input of the neural unit comes from the intermediate state extracted by the previous neuron in turn, and the perception of the intermediate state information output by the neuron with a long interval is weak. To enhance the ability of the model to perceive the load in a long period, we designed a \"jump mechanism\" based on the original LSTM sequence, as shown in Fig. 9 . The jumping mechanism can make the output of neurons ignore the information processing of N steps continuously, and establish a point-to-point information transmission channel with long-spaced neurons. In this paper, the information channel between the same time sampling points and the predicted time points in different periods is constructed by means of the jump mechanism in Eq (20\u201323). After the LSTM unit extracts the hidden state of the load sequence, Skip-LSTM captures the effect of long interval repetition period information on the predicted value. (20) f t = σ ( w f ⋅ [ h t − n , x t ] + b f ) (21) i t = σ ( w i ⋅ [ h t − n , x t ] + b i ) (22) C t = tanh ( w c ⋅ [ h t − n , x t ] + b c ) (23) o t = σ ( w o ⋅ [ h t − n , x t ] + b o ) 3.2 Proposed model in this paper The IES multi-load short-term prediction model proposed in this paper is shown in Fig. 10 , which combines multi-layer LSTM, Skip-LSTM, fully connected layer and attention mechanism. (1) Feature Attention based on MLP: Integrating various critical meteorological factors to characterize the impact of load fluctuations, delineating the impact weights of various meteorological factors on the load at different time points. (2) LSTM sequences: The output of the MLP attention mechanism is used as input to the LSTM sequence. Stacked multi-layer LSTM networks are employed to extract deep features from the data fused by MLP, thereby facilitating the exploration of inter-load periodic relationships through jump mechanisms (3) Skip-LSTM: Establishing a cross-time-step information jumping mechanism between intermediate states of LSTM outputs enables the model to explore interactions across multiple neurons. This facilitates the analysis of repetitive patterns in long-term sequential data and enhances the model's capability to explore features of long-term cycles. Jump length determination is based on the autocorrelation computed from self-repeating functions. (4) Fully connected layer: Aggregate multiple output values generated by the jump mechanism, where each channel's output can reflect periodic connections for individual loads. A linear fully connected layer can establish multi-period connections between different loads, thereby enhancing the model's ability to explore multi-period connections. 3.3 Error evaluation index Multi-task learning needs to consider the weight distribution of multiple subtask errors. Generally, the weight coefficient is set according to the predicted difficulty and importance of the subtask. Based on the above two points and other references, we set different weight coefficients in different modes by Eq. (24). As the core energy of the system, the power load is set to a maximum weight of 0.4. The cooling and thermal loads are set to 0.35 and 0.25 respectively in different modes. (24) L oss = ∂ L os s e l e + β L os s cold + δ L os s h o t Where: L os s ele , L os s cold and L os s t h e r m a l are the loss weight of single-task, ∂ , β , δ are the loss weights of single-task. The MAE, MAPE, RMSE were used to reflect the fitting relationship between the predicted value and the real value by Eq. (25\u201327). (25) M A E = 1 n ∑ 1 n | y ^ i − y i | (26) M A P E = 100 % n ∑ i = 1 n | y ^ i − y i y i | (27) R M S E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y ^ i − y i ) 2 Where: n is the sample size of the load, y ^ i and y i are the predicted and actual values respectively. 4 Case study 4.1 Case study introduction The case study utilizes the IES load data from the Arizona State University Tempe campus platform [29] for the years 2020-2021, along with meteorological data from the nearest Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport weather station [30], for research purposes. The load data comprise consumption values for three categories: electricity, cooling, and heating. With a prediction interval of one hour, this results in 24 sampling points per day, and model training is conducted using a single-step point prediction approach. All simulation experiments were implemented in PyCharm using Python under the Torch framework. For ease of computation, all units of measurement were uniformly set to kW. (29) 1 k W = 3.4 m B t u / h = 0.284 t o n − h r 4.2 Model inputs and hyperparameters Based on the analysis of coupling relationships, the load and meteorological data generated between 2020 and 2021 were systematically categorized into two distinct coupling patterns. Pattern 1, spanning April to September each year, was characterized by the dominance of cooling and electrical loads, encompassing a total of 366 days. Conversely, Pattern 2, spanning January to March and October to December annually, was characterized by the dominance of heating and electrical loads, totaling 365 days. The data sets for training, testing, and validation under each pattern were proportioned at an 8:1:1 ratio. Subsequently, the model's performance evaluation was conducted using the data from September and December 2021 as the respective test sets for the two patterns. Predictive errors were employed as indicators of model performance, and a comparative analysis of point predictions within a seven-day period was illustrated. The resulting graphical representations encapsulate the distinctive data features input into the model under different coupling patterns. Furthermore, based on the causal analysis of various loads and meteorological features under distinct coupling patterns derived from feature engineering, three meteorological features exhibiting pronounced causal relationships were identified. These features were incorporated into the model's input through a feature attention mechanism, assigning varying meteorological weights to each load sequence. This intricate process resulted in the formulation of the ultimate feature sequence inputted into the model shown in Fig. 11 . To validate the effectiveness of the predictive model proposed in this study, which incorporates meteorological factors and repetitive cycles, we constructed multi-task comparative models and single-task models predicting electrical, cooling, and heating loads under identical contexts. The multi-task models were designed without considering meteorological factors and with multiple leap lengths. The single-task models encompassed the single-task form of the model proposed in this paper, Attention-LSTM, SVR, and RF. Table 3 detailing the input and parameter configurations of the multi-task models under various conditions is presented. To obtain the optimal architecture for the deep learning model, this study employed a longitudinal comparative method with controlled variables to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters. Optimal selections were made for parameters such as the number of neurons in model components and the number of hidden layers. When analyzing the impact of a specific parameter on prediction outcomes, all other parameters were held constant. During the computational simulations, it was observed that as the number of hidden layers increased gradually from 1 to 3, the weighted mean accuracy of test samples improved from 0.8987 to 0.9547, but declined gradually beyond 3 layers. To effectively illustrate the error variations during the tuning process, MAPE was used as a benchmark for evaluating hyperparameter optimization. The optimal parameters for a layer were achieved at their lowest point when the LSTM layer was set to 3 and the hidden layer count to 8. Subsequently, while keeping LSTM sequence parameters unchanged, adjustments were made to parameters such as learning rate and the number of neurons in the FC layer to achieve optimal results. As shown in Fig. 12 , the results demonstrate that the aforementioned approach also entailed iterative exploration and optimization of other hyperparameters. 4.3 Model component testing Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 respectively illustrate the prediction curves of the proposed multitask model considering different components under various coupling modes. The error indicators of the prediction curves under different coupling modes are presented in Table 4 and Table 5 . To clearly demonstrate the repetitive behavior of the curves, the prediction results for electricity, cooling, and heating load curves were selected from the test set for the periods of September 1st to 7th, 2021, and December 1st to 7th, 2021. Analysis of error metrics under Mode 1 in Table 5 reveals that, compared to Case 2, the MAE, MAPE, and RMSE for electricity, cooling, and heating in Case 1 had all decreased. This suggests that augmenting meteorological factors as auxiliary features can significantly enhance prediction accuracy. In contrast to Case 2, the model proposed in Case 3 incorporates a jumping mechanism capable of capturing long-cycle cyclic features. The most significant reduction in prediction error occurred in cooling load, with MAE and MAPE decreasing by 31 % and RMSE by 28 %. These results indicated that neighboring periods provide valuable references for predictions. Compared with Case 3, Case 4 further considers load autocorrelation function value indicators in its jumping mechanism. Within Mode 1, the high consumption and volatility of electricity and cooling loads pose significant prediction challenges. However, incorporating increased jump lengths leads to decreases in MAPE for electricity and cooling loads by 7.4 % and 17.6 %, respectively. Fig. 14 and Table 5 present the prediction errors for various scenarios under Mode 2. Compared to Case 1, the prediction errors for all types of loads in Case 2 had also decreased, indicating that augmenting critical meteorological factors as key features can reduce prediction errors. Compared to Case 2, the MAPE for cooling load decreased by 21 % in Case 3. This suggests that during the cold winter, cooling load consumption exhibits irregular patterns, and uncovering long-cycle relationships aids in improving model accuracy. Compared to Case 3, the MAPE for electricity and cooling loads decreases by 14.8 % and 37 % respectively in Case 4, indicating that considering longer time steps in jump lengths contributes more to exploring cyclic features. For heating load, which remains in a high consumption state during the cold winter, Case 4 exhibits a 15.6 % decrease compared to Case 1. This suggests that considering meteorological factors and repetitive cycles can reduce prediction errors, although the pipeline's thermal transmission delay characteristics pose significant prediction challenges. 4.4 Multitask model performance testing Furthermore, to validate the superiority of the proposed multitask model, recent and well-established single-task machine learning models, as well as the single-task mode of the proposed model, were employed as control groups for comparative simulations on the same dataset. Table 6 provides the specific parameters for Attention-LSTM, SVR, RF, and the proposed Single-task model. Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 depict the comparative prediction curves of the two modes over a continuous week on the same dataset. Model comparison errors are illustrated in Fig. 17 . Through the analysis of error curve comparisons, the proposed multitask model demonstrates superior performance, indicating that considering the repetitive cycles of individual loads and training them jointly by incorporating the repetitive cycle features of multiple loads as shared data can enhance prediction accuracy. From the analysis of prediction errors in both modes, the multitask model proposed in this study exhibits the smallest prediction errors. The MAPE for electricity load prediction is merely 5.025 % and 2.297 % respectively, representing reductions of 6.8 % and 15.2 % compared to the single-task mode of the proposed model. The Predictive errors for the two typical single-task learning methods, RF and SVR, are comparatively larger. The single-task form of the proposed model, compared to Attention-LSTM, incorporates a jumping mechanism capable of capturing long cyclic features, resulting in respective reductions of 31.3 % and 26 % in cold prediction errors in Mode 1 and Mode 2. This underscores that thorough exploration of long-cycle features can enhance the prediction efficacy for loads such as cooling, which involve pipeline transmission. Moreover, under Mode 1, where there is significant fluctuation in cooling load consumption, the proposed model effectively mitigates prediction errors. Similarly, under Mode 2, characterized by colder climates making heating load consumption challenging to predict, the proposed model maintains prediction errors for heating loads at relatively low levels. 5 Conclusion In order to enhance the multi-load prediction accuracy of district-scale integrated energy systems, this paper proposes a MTL approach incorporating Skip LSTM and Attention mechanisms. Through detailed case analyses, the following conclusions are drawn: 1) To investigate the impact of seasonal meteorological factors on system coupling patterns and load fluctuations, a combined method of ADF test and TE was employed for key meteorological feature extraction after coupling pattern division. This approach facilitates a clear delineation of coupling patterns, resulting in superior feature extraction. 2) Performance testing of various components of the proposed multi-task model was conducted, with horizontal comparative experiments against classical single-task models. Among the different components of the multi-task model, the model proposed in this study (Case 4) exhibits optimal performance, validating the superiority of the proposed multi-task sharing and skipping mechanisms. In comparison to single-task models, the proposed model maintains optimal performance even in months with significant consumption and fluctuation in cold and hot load curves, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed model. 3) Next, we will extend our research to IES in industrial parks, which have broader practical applications. Building on consideration of meteorological factors and energy consumption periodicity, we will further refine the granularity of prediction targets to accurately forecast load consumption for various buildings within the parks. Additionally, this study did not account for the influence of electricity pricing on load consumption or the time costs associated with model training, which will be addressed in future research.

        "dc:description": "In response to the characteristics of multiple loads coupled within integrated energy systems, strong seasonality, and pronounced short-term repetitive patterns, this study proposes a method for identifying key meteorological features based on ADF and TE and an improved IES short-term multi-energy load joint prediction method using Skip-LSTM. Initially, the stability of seasonal loads is considered to determine typical load coupling patterns over extended periods, with key meteorological factors affecting load fluctuations extracted using the TE algorithm. Subsequently, short-term load curve repetitive patterns are obtained under different coupling modes utilizing autocorrelation functions. Finally, key meteorological factors and load values are separately input into the proposed MTL-Skip LSTM-Attention model for different coupling modes. The model employs a feature attention mechanism to weigh the influence of meteorological factors, constructs stacked LSTMs to extract deep-state representations of weighted sequences, enables Skip-LSTM to capture long-cycle curve repetitive patterns, and incorporates a linear layer to fuse feature values at different skip intervals for prediction. Testing of the proposed model under mode-1 in real-world scenarios reveals a reduction in MAPE errors for electricity-cooling-heating predictions by 15.6 %, 52.7 %, and 4.7 % respectively, compared with the traditional attention-LSTM model, thus validating the superiority of the proposed approach.",
