Transparent self-cleaning coatings have garnered significant attention for their promising prospects in outdoor applications, particularly in solar panels and high-end optical devices. However, existing technologies still grapple with the challenges of achieving high transmittance and superior weather resistance. Therefore, developing cost-effective coatings that possess both high transparency and excellent durability is paramount. A novel method for synthesizing an anti-reflective (AR) coating is presented in this paper, offering simplicity, cost-efficiency, and high performance. By merging acid-base catalyzed sol-gel chemistry with the dip-coating process, the coating's transparency, durability, and hydrophobicity are notably improved. Production time is significantly reduced through process optimization. The AR coating achieves an exceptional transmittance of 97.3 % at 620 nm, a 6.7 % increase over that of untreated glass. Furthermore, its 145° water contact angle demonstrates excellent hydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties. Mechanical stability tests indicate that the coating retains over 96 % transmittance even after 30 tape adhesion cycles. Long-term UV exposure tests reveal that the coating's transmittance and contact angle remain almost unchanged, underscoring its superior environmental stability and weather resistance. Additionally, the coating enhances the transmittance of multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells compared to commercial glass, boosting the photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 11.04 % to 11.81 %, an increase of 7 %. With these exceptional properties, this coating holds significant potential for applications in mc-Si solar cells and high-end optical devices, providing the industry with an efficient and economical solution.

To mitigate these issues, the technology of anti-reflective (AR) coating has garnered considerable attention over recent decades [1\u20133]. Whether single-layered or multilayered, AR coating is meticulously designed with specific thicknesses and refractive indices, typically positioned between air and the transparent substrate, to minimize reflections and amplify light transmission. These coatings effectively mitigate unwanted Fresnel reflections at interfaces, demonstrating immense potential across various optical devices, solar cells, and laser systems [4\u201317]. In recent years, substantial endeavors have been dedicated to augmenting the multifunctionality of AR coating. Researchers have explored diverse fabrication techniques such as physical vapor deposition, layer-by-layer assembly, and block copolymer phase separation to address broader application requisites [18\u201320]. However, due to its manufacturing complexity, difficulty in accurately adjusting refractive index (N) and coating thickness, and inability to use large-scale substrates, despite the success of these methodologies at a laboratory scale, single-function transmissive coating often falls short of meeting the intricate demands of practical applications. Consequently, the industry has proposed more stringent performance requirements for AR coating. Moreover, superhydrophobic surface technologies, due to their low surface energy [21] and the presence of micro/nano-scale roughness [22], have garnered significant acclaim for their pronounced self-cleaning capabilities. Surfaces boasting high water contact angles can effectively clean dust, thereby sustaining clarity and transparency. Nevertheless, enhancing hydrophobic properties typically compromises light transmission, as heightened surface roughness engenders light scattering [23]. Thus, a substantial challenge is presented in harmonizing surface roughness and optical transparency. For instance, Sun's team developed a super hydrophobic double-layer antireflection coating with a hydrophobic Angle of 151°, an average transmittance of 95.3 % in the visible range of 400\u2013800 nm, a low transmittance of the coating, and a long reaction aging time [24]. The three-layer anti-reflection film prepared by Xu's team has excellent performance, with an average transmission of 98.41 % at 400\u2013800 nm, but the contact Angle of the anti-reflection film is only 101° [25]. At the same time, the optical and mechanical properties of the coating are also needed to be considered. Kareem's team developed a transparent silica gel for the synthesis of anti-reflective (AR) and superhydrophobic (SH) films on sodium-calcium glass. The resulting films have an average light transmittivity and hydrostatic contact Angle (CA) of 93.1 % and 169.7°, respectively, but the mechanical properties of the films are poor [26]. Despite their outstanding optical performance, superhydrophobic coatings applied to photovoltaic panel surfaces are susceptible to environmental influences and dust accumulation. Consequently, the superhydrophobic attributes may gradually diminish over time [27,28], necessitating the formulation of superhydrophobic coatings endowed with enhanced mechanical durability and resilience to harsh climates. Although alkali-catalyzed silica coatings exhibit excellent transmittance, due to the random stacking of silica particles with only point contact, they are prone to mechanical abrasions [29]. Conversely, acid-catalyzed silica transmissive coatings, composed of strongly interlinked linear chains, offer robust adhesion on substrates. Nonetheless, the linear structure results in low porosity, leading to high refractive indices and diminished transmittance [30]. Thus, neither alkali-catalyzed nor acid-catalyzed coatings can simultaneously offer outstanding transmittance and high abrasion resistance. The optimal solution entails the development of broadband transmissive coating amalgamating the advantages of alkali and acid-catalyzed coating to obtain marvelous transmittance and mechanical sturdiness. The sol-gel chemistry and dip-coating method is widely used in the fabrication of nanomaterials and thin films because of its simplicity and cost effectiveness. By adjusting the microstructure of colloidal particles and chemical composition, the refractive index is precisely adjusted, with good film-forming capacity, low processing temperature, and good coating thickness [31,32]. In this work, a cost-effective and expeditious method was introduced that integrates acid-alkali mixed catalysis sol-gel technology with dipping techniques. By combining the advantages of base and acid catalysis, we have successfully synthesized a transparent, weather-resistant self-cleaning anti-reflective coating. The low-refractive coating (∼1.25) has excellent optical properties, reaching a peak of 97.4 %, surpassing that of untreated glass (90.6 %), while maintaining a WCA of 145°. The coating also demonstrates exceptional mechanical strength, temperature resistance, durability, and UV resistance. Despite undergoing 10, 20, and 30 cycles of adhesive tape peeling and sticking, its transmittance only marginally declines from the initial 97.4 %\u201395.7 %, with the hydrophobic angle sustained at 136°. Meanwhile, after a month of continuous exposure in a UV chamber (340 nm) simulating 45 °C and 0.89W/m2 irradiance, the coating's transmittance remains above 97 %, with the contact angle above 140°. The substantial increase in the J SC, which escalated from 25.82 mA/cm2 to 28.46 mA/cm2, has achieved an approximate enhancement of 10.2 %. Correspondingly, the PCE has also seen a significant rise, increasing from 11.04 % to 11.81 %, marking an important improvement of 7 %. The application of an AR coating underscores its pivotal role in mitigating light loss and enhancing the PCE of the mc-Si solar cells. Given these robust findings, our work is poised to have extensive future applications. We are confident that this research will offer a novel perspective for advancing high-performance AR coatings and catalyze further technological advancements in the field. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Deionized water was prepared using a laboratory water purification system. Glass slides (25 × 75 × 3.5 mm³, model 10127101P-G) were obtained from Jiangsu Shitai Experimental Equipment Co., Ltd. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, AR) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.99 %, AR) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol (EtOH, ≥99.5 %, AR), ammonia solution (NH4OH, 25\u201328 %, AR), and n-hexane (≥97.0 %, AR) were purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Group. Trimethyl (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyl) silane (98 %) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 28 %, AR) was sourced from Xinyang Chemical Reagent Factory. The glass slides were cleaned with deionized water, air-dried, and then cleaned using a plasma cleaner at 500\u2013600 W for 100s. The multi-crystalline silicon solar cells were purchased from Shenzhen Tuozhanteng Electronic Components Co., Ltd., with specifications of 0.5 V, 160 mA, and dimensions of 53 × 18 mm. Except for deionized water and the glass slides, all other chemicals were used without further purification. 2.2 Experimental procedure 2.2.1 Preparation of silica sol Silica sols were synthesized using the Stöber method [33]. Initially, The precursor tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was selected as the silicon source. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was gradually added to a mixture containing ethanol (EtOH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and deionized water to catalyze the hydrolysis of TEOS. The molar ratio of the reactants was ethanol: TEOS: water: ammonium hydroxide = 49:1:3:8. After stirring the mixture at 60 °C in a water bath for 1.5 h, it was ventilated in a fume hood for 2 h to expel ammonia gas, resulting in the formation of a light blue silica sol, referred to as Sol A. Subsequently, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was added to Sol A at a mass fraction of 0.5 %, and the reaction was continued at 60 °C in a water bath for an additional 3 h to produce Sol B. An alternative silica sol [34], Sol C, was synthesized via an acid-catalyzed method. This process involved mixing TEOS, deionized water, hydrochloric acid (HCl), and ethanol in a molar ratio of 1:1:0.01:20. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h and then allowed to age for three days. Finally, a hybrid sol, Sol D, was created by combining the alkali-catalyzed Sol B with the acid-catalyzed Sol C in a mass ratio of 5:1. 2.2.2 Preparation of silica coating The coating was applied using an HTDC-300 dip-coater. Before application, glass substrates were meticulously cleaned through a sequential ultrasonic process using detergent, ethanol, and deionized water, each for 15 min. Clean the substrate surface to ensure good adhesion of the coating. The SiO2 sol was then deposited on these prepared substrates employing a dip-coating technique that entailed both immersion and withdrawal. The descent and ascent rates were consistently maintained at 1000 μm/s, with each immersion lasting 120 s. After each dip, the substrates were allowed to air dry at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 min and were then oven-dried at 60 °C for 30 min. N-hexane and Trimethyl (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyl) silane were prepared in a solution with a mass fraction of 50:1. The coating process was completed with three 10-min immersions in a fluorine-based solution, achieving a transparent and durable antireflective coating. This entire procedure is depicted in Fig. 1 . 2.3 Characterization A JSM-7500F scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the microstructure of the coating at an accelerating voltage ranging from 0.1 to 20 kV, capturing microstructural images of the coating. An ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrophotometer (UV-2500) measured the optical transmittance in the wavelength range of 300\u2013900 nm, with a resolution of 1 nm. The static contact angle of water on the prepared coating was measured at room temperature using a SCI3000F automatic contact angle meter, by placing a 5 μL water droplet on the coating surface. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (manufactured by PE, USA) was used for near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to conduct surface chemical analysis of the coating. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE-VE) and the Cauchy model determined the refractive index of the deposited coating and solar glass substrates. An atomic force microscope from Bruker, USA, was used to study the surface roughness. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Chemical structure and morphology of the coating Two distinct types of silica sols with unique microstructures were developed. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , ammonium hydroxide in an alkaline environment facilitates the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and the subsequent condensation of silanol groups to form spherical nanoparticles due to the condensation rate of SiO2 is significantly faster than the hydrolysis of TEOS [35]. These spherical particles, with their highly consistent size and uniform distribution, the resultant coating boast enhanced transmittance. In contrast, hydrochloric acid, serving as an acidic catalyst, the hydrolysis of TEOS plays a more active role than its condensation guides the formation of linear chain-like silica sol, and contributes positively to the material's mechanical properties [36]. When these two silica sols are blended under specific conditions, their distinctive microstructures intertwine to form a composite nano-network that consists of spherical nanoparticles and linear siloxane chains. This structure not only endows the material with exceptional light transmittance but also allows silica-based materials to distribute and absorb energy more effectively under external stress, thereby achieving mechanical reinforcement. As shown in Fig. 3 , infrared spectroscopy analysis reveals the presence of Si-CH3 and Si-O-Si structures in the HMDS-modified, alkaline-catalyzed silica sol coating, as well as the synergistic effect of these structures with additional C-F bonds in the acid-base combined silica sol coating. The absorption peaks at 1258 cm−1 and 1064 cm−1 confirm the presence of the siloxane network and methylsilane in the coating. The characteristic absorption of the C-F bond in the acid-base combined silica sol coating, observed at 755 cm−1, indicates the integration of the fluorinated hydrophobic modifier. This not only enhances the hydrophobicity of the material's surface but also improves the structural integrity and mechanical stability of the coating through chemical cross-linking. Additionally, the hydroxyl (-OH) absorption peak at 3500 cm−1 in the acid-base combined silica sol coating is stronger than in the HMDS-modified sample, indicating that acidic conditions may have inhibited the condensation of some Si-OH groups, leaving more unreacted hydroxyl groups. 3.2 Morphology of coating In Fig. 4 a, it is depicted that the surface morphology of the alkaline-catalyzed silica sol coating appears uniform and well-aligned, demonstrating a high level of consistency. In contrast, Fig. 4b reveals that the acid-base combination silica sol coating surface consists of diverse nanoparticles of varying sizes, which aggregate and tightly pack together to form a hierarchical rough structure. This unique nanoscale surface morphology significantly enhances the interfacial adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate. This improvement may be attributed to the increased surface contact area of the nanoparticles and the enhanced interfacial friction resulting from mechanical interlocking. The tiny mechanical interlocks that form between particles and between the particles and the substrate play a crucial role in the overall adhesion of the coating. Detailed surface morphology analysis of the silica-based acid-alkaline catalyzed coating was conducted using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4c, the coating shows a significant height variation in the range of 32.1 nm\u2013694.0 nm, with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 33.0 nm, reflecting a degree of surface inhomogeneity, which is further validated by the coating thickness analysis (Fig. S1). The multi-layer roughness of the surface creates many air pockets at the microscopic level, which is essential to enhance the hydrophobic properties of the coating. When water droplets come into contact with this surface, the air pocket acts as a barrier, limiting the contact between water molecules and the coating, thus significantly increasing the contact Angle of the surface and giving it a significant hydrophobicity. In addition, transmission electron microscopy images (Fig. S2) revealed inconsistencies in silica particle size, further confirming the effect of coating inhomogeneity on the increase in roughness and the resulting increase in hydrophobic properties. At the same time, the calculated result of the coating porosity using ImageJ software is 34.11 %. The existence of pores enhances the micro and macro roughness of the surface, which can improve the hydrophobic Angle of the coating. 3.3 Optical properties of coating The transmittance and refractive index are critical parameters for assessing the optical properties of the coating. The relationship between these properties is typically described by the Fresnel equation, which applies to non-absorbing media with normal light incidence [37]: (1) T = ( 1 \u2010 ( n \u2010 1 n + 1 ) 2 ) 2 Where T denotes transmittance and n is the refractive index. Lowering the refractive index can reduce reflectance, thereby increasing transmittance. To achieve the utmost control over optical interference, the optical thickness of coatings is typically set to a quarter of the wavelength of the applied light, which is represented as λ / 4 . According to the optical formula d = λ 4 n , where λ is the wavelength in the medium and n is the refractive index, the optimal transmittance for a single-layer anti-reflective coating is achieved when the thickness of the coating is λ / 4 n [38]. In pursuit of the highest transmittance, we have selected a wavelength of 620 nm, which, based on our calculations, yields a theoretical film thickness of 155 nm. This theoretical value closely matches the actual film thickness obtained in our experiments, as depicted in Fig. S1, thereby validating the efficacy and precision of our coating design. In Fig. 5 a, the refractive index of the incident medium is n 0 , and the refractive index of the substrate is n 1 . The refractive index of the coating material that fulfills the conditions for destructive interference can be calculated as n = n 0 n 1 . The light beam reflected from the upper surface of the coating is labeled R1, and the beam reflected from the lower surface is R2. With an optical thickness of 1/4 of the wavelength, the path difference between R1 and R2 is 1/2 of the wavelength, satisfying interference conditions and resulting in destructive interference. This significantly diminishes the intensity of the reflected beam, achieving the desired anti-reflective effect. This theoretical foundation provides a framework for understanding the coating's optical properties. In an alkaline-catalyzed system, ammonium hydroxide is used as a catalyst to accelerate the hydrolysis of the silane precursor and its uniform condensation reaction. The data presented in Fig. 5b indicate silica coating prepared in a base-catalyzed way achieves the highest transmittance, reaching 99.3 %, which is an 8.7 % increase over the 90.6 % of the glass substrate, and has a refractive index of 1.30. This refractive index suggests that the unmodified coating has a high density and a compact internal structure. Introducing hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for surface modification in this system slightly reduces the coating's transmittance to 98.5 %, but it still remains 7.9 % higher than that of the glass substrate. This suggests that the addition of HMDS might optimize the coating's microstructure, reducing its density, thereby enhancing optical transparency and reducing light scattering. Conversely, in the acid-catalyzed system, where hydrochloric acid is used as the catalyst, the precursor hydrolysis is promoted, but at a slower rate, with faster condensation, leading to a coating transmittance of only 93.3 %, just a 2.7 % improvement over the glass substrate. This is likely due to the denser and slightly uneven internal structure of the coating under acid catalysis, which increases light scattering. In the acid-alkaline combined catalytic system, the coating's transmittance is 97.4 %, which is 6.8 % higher than the glass substrate, with a refractive index of 1.25 (Fig. 5d). The comparison in Fig. 5c shows that the coating significantly improves optical transmittance compared to bare glass. We take advantage of the optical interference effect to minimize reflection. The one-quarter wavelength thickness of the coating ensures that the reflected waves of the incident light interfere with the reflected waves of the lower interface of the coating, thus significantly reducing reflection losses. This suggests that the acid-alkaline combined catalytic strategy optimizes the coating's network structure, balancing density and porosity to achieve optimal transmissivity. 3.4 Wetting properties of coating Wettability is an essential factor for applications in anti-fouling and moisture barrier technologies. Thus, the self-cleaning experiment was used to evaluate the hydrophobicity of silica sol coatings modified with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and doped with a fluorinated hydrophobic agent. The unmodified silica sol coatings were prepared using alkaline catalysis, showing a contact angle of around 42° (Fig. 6 a), indicating hydrophilicity. This hydrophilicity is due to the polar silanol groups (Si-OH) on the silica sol surface forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules. After modification with HMDS, the coating's contact angle increased to approximately 142°, significantly improving its hydrophobicity. Since the methylsiloxane groups (Si-CH3) replaced the silanol groups, reducing the coating's affinity for water. However, this modification had limited improvement in the coating's mechanical properties. To enhance its mechanical stability, acid-catalyzed silica sol was introduced. However, acid catalysis led to an increase in silanol groups, reducing the contact angle to 90° and diminishing hydrophobicity. To address this, we further introduced a fluorinated hydrophobic agent into the acid-alkaline co-catalyzed silica sol. The final acid-alkaline combined silica sol coating had its contact angle restored to 145° (Fig. 6c) and exhibited excellent hydrophobicity in different liquids (Fig. 6b). The fluorinated hydrophobic agent not only increased surface roughness but also formed low-surface-energy fluorocarbon groups (C-F) on the coating surface. These highly hydrophobic groups effectively repel water molecules, significantly enhancing overall hydrophobicity. The high contact angle of the acid-alkaline combined silica sol coating not only demonstrates its superior hydrophobicity but also imparts self-cleaning properties. In Fig. 6(d\u2013i), sand was sprinkled on both bare glass and coated glass. On bare glass surfaces, the removal of sand particles by water droplets is challenging, however, on coated glass, droplets glide swiftly, carrying away the particles and showcasing the surface's exceptional self-cleaning properties. 3.5 Mechanical stability of the coating Combining acid and base catalysts leverages the advantages of both catalysts to enhance coating performance by reducing micro-defects, improving adhesion, and optimizing the micro and macro structures. We evaluated the coating's mechanical stability through tape adhesion and water drop impact tests. A tape peel test was used to assess the adhesion of the AR coating (Text S1). Fig. 7 a demonstrates the application and removal of a 3M Type 600 transparent tape on the coating surface. After 10, 20, and 30 cycles of adhesion and peeling, the coating's transmittance slightly decreased from 97.3 % to 96.2 % (Fig. 7b). Compared to the glass substrate's transmittance of 90.6 %, the AR coating showed a 5.6 % improvement. The contact angle decreased from 145° to 136° (Fig. 7c), a reduction of only 9°. As shown in Fig. 7(d\u2013f), the coating was inclined at 30° and placed 50 cm from a running water tap to observe the impact of water drops from 10,000 to 100,000 hits. The results showed that after 100,000 water drop impacts, the coating maintained a transmittance of 95.4 %, which is 4.8 % higher than bare glass. The contact angle remained at 140° and demonstrated excellent impact resistance. These results demonstrate the coating's excellent adhesion and mechanical stability while maintaining high transmittance and hydrophobicity. 3.6 Weatherability of coating In Fig. 8 a and b, the chemical stability of the coatings is assessed through immersion in solutions with pH levels of 1 and 13 over 72 h, respectively. After immersion in the pH 1 acidic solution for 72 h, the coating still had a transmittance above 96 % and a contact angle greater than 140°, indicating that the coating maintained good structural and surface integrity in a strong acid environment. This resistance could be attributed to the chemical inertness of the coating material and its corrosion resistance to acidic solutions. However, in an alkaline environment, the coating's transmittance dropped to 94.3 % and the contact angle decreased to 126°. This decline is likely due to the reaction of silica in an alkaline environment, causing hydrolysis of the siloxane bonds in the coating, which compromises the coating's integrity and affects its optical and hydrophobic properties. To assess thermal stability, we measured the coated glass's contact angle and transmittance after 30 h of treatment at high (100 °C) and low (−25 °C) temperatures. As shown in Fig. 8c and d, after 30 h of treatment, the coating maintained a transmittance of around 97 % and a contact angle above 140°. The demonstrated stability underscores the coating's exceptional thermal endurance within a wide temperature spectrum. This is presumably attributed to the maintenance of structural integrity at both elevated and reduced temperatures, consequently sustaining the material's optical clarity and hydrophobic attributes. Additionally, we placed the coating in a UV accelerated weathering test chamber device (Fig. S3) that simulated UV radiation with a temperature of 45 °C and an irradiation intensity of 0.89W/m2 for one month (Text S2). Results indicated negligible alterations in the coating's transmittance and contact angle, as depicted in Fig. 8e. The transmittance also remained stable in different humidity environments (Fig. 8f). Findings further indicate that surface coating exhibits outstanding weather resistance, which makes the coating material suitable for use in various harsh environments. Furthermore, Table 1 encapsulates a comprehensive summary of various coatings, detailing their transmittance, contact angle, UV exposure time, contact Angle changes after UV exposure, and aging time. Table 2 summarizes the price comparison of materials (/100 ml) used in different experimental methods. Our coating shows the comprehensive performance of low cost and excellent durability, which provides a broad prospect for practical application, indicating that it has great potential and application value in various industries. 3.7 Applications of coatings on solar cells Multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells currently lead the photovoltaic sector, owing to their extensive deployment and technological maturity. Our research focused on the profound effects of anti-reflective coatings on mc-Si solar cells' performance. Fig. 9 distinctly illustrates the influence of AR coatings, with two sets of J/V curves (Fig. 9a) and relative power efficiency graphs (Fig. 9b) delineating the performance disparities. The measurements were carried out under illumination of 100 mW/cm2 AM1.5 G. Uncoated cells displayed comparatively short-circuit currents ( J SC ), which resulted in diminished maximum power points ( P max ) and a peak power efficiency of merely 11.04 %. Conversely, mc-Si solar cells enhanced with AR coatings exhibited superior performance under identical testing conditions. Due to its exceptional anti-reflective properties, the J SC of the mc-Si solar cell has recorded a significant increase, rising from 25.82 mA/cm2 to 28.46 mA/cm2, achieving an approximate enhancement of 10.2 %. The increase in transmittance directly leads to more photons being absorbed by the battery material, increasing the production of photogenerated charge carriers, which in turn increases the photocurrent and the output power of the battery. Increased transmission leads to increased J SC [50]. The increase in J SC is a pivotal indicator of the optimization of solar cell performance, signifying an enhanced efficiency in capturing photons and converting them into electrical current. Demonstrating that AR coatings significantly boost light absorption and current generation. Consequently, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) was elevated to 11.81 %, an increase of 7 %, underscoring the pivotal role of AR coatings in minimizing light losses and augmenting PCE, thereby affirming their substantial utility in elevating the overall efficacy of solar cells. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and practicality of antireflective coatings prepared using the acid-base mixed catalysis sol-gel method to enhance the performance of optical devices. This innovative coating leverages the combined benefits of acidic and basic catalysts, achieving high transmittance, improved mechanical strength, and excellent hydrophobic properties. Transmittance of the coating across the 380\u2013780 nm visible light range consistently exceeded 95 %, peaking at 97.4 %, which is a 6.8 % increase over that of glass substrates, with a refractive index of 1.25. The hydrophobic angle measures at 145°. Despite 30 cycles of adhesive tape peeling and sticking, the initial transmittance of 97.4 % only marginally dipped to 95.7 %, and the hydrophobic angle remained robust at 136°. After 100,000 water drop impacts, the coating maintained a transmittance of 95.4 %, which is 4.8 % higher than bare glass. The contact angle remained at 140°. Enduring a month of simulated UV exposure at 45 °C and an irradiance of 0.89W/m2, the coating's transmittance remained above 97 %, with the contact angle still above 140°. Such versatility in technology renders it highly suitable for a variety of high-performance applications, notably in enhancing the efficiency of solar cells and optical devices. The J SC has witnessed a substantial increase, escalating from 25.82 mA/cm2 to 28.46 mA/cm2, achieving an approximate enhancement of 10.2 %. Corresponding PCE increased from 11.04 % to 11.81 %, a significant rise of 7 %. The AR coating highlights the crucial role of reducing light loss and augmenting the PCE of the cells. This work opens up a new direction for the future development of optical materials and introduces practical new technology for related industrial applications.

        "dc:description": "Transparent self-cleaning coatings have garnered significant attention for their promising prospects in outdoor applications, particularly in solar panels and high-end optical devices. However, existing technologies still grapple with the challenges of achieving high transmittance and superior weather resistance. Therefore, developing cost-effective coatings that possess both high transparency and excellent durability is paramount. A novel method for synthesizing an anti-reflective (AR) coating is presented in this paper, offering simplicity, cost-efficiency, and high performance. By merging acid-base catalyzed sol-gel chemistry with the dip-coating process, the coating's transparency, durability, and hydrophobicity are notably improved. Production time is significantly reduced through process optimization. The AR coating achieves an exceptional transmittance of 97.3 % at 620 nm, a 6.7 % increase over that of untreated glass. Furthermore, its 145° water contact angle demonstrates excellent hydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties. Mechanical stability tests indicate that the coating retains over 96 % transmittance even after 30 tape adhesion cycles. Long-term UV exposure tests reveal that the coating's transmittance and contact angle remain almost unchanged, underscoring its superior environmental stability and weather resistance. Additionally, the coating enhances the transmittance of multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells compared to commercial glass, boosting the photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 11.04 % to 11.81 %, an increase of 7 %. With these exceptional properties, this coating holds significant potential for applications in mc-Si solar cells and high-end optical devices, providing the industry with an efficient and economical solution.",
