Generally speaking, the precursors of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are very low in desert areas due to the lack of anthropogenic emissions and natural emissions, and thus O3 concentrations are relatively low. However, high summer background concentrations of about 100 µg/m3 or 60 ppb were found in the Alxa Desert in the highland of northwest China based on continuous summer observations from 2019 to 2021, which was higher than the most of natural background areas or clean areas in world for summer O3 background concentrations. The high O3 background concentrations were related to surface features and altitude. Heavy-intensity anthropogenic activity areas in desert areas can cause increased O3 concentrations or pollution, but also generated O3 depleting substances such as nitrous oxide, which eventually reduced the regional O3 baseline values. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) also had a dual effect on O3 generation, showing promotion at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. In addition, sand-dust weather reduced O3 clearly, but O3 eventually stabilized around the background concentration values and did not vary with sand-dust particulate matter. Graphic abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Alxa Desert O3 background concentration Anthropogenic effect Sand-dust weather Northwest China Introduction Ozone (O3) is a key component of the Earth's atmosphere which plays an important role in air quality, atmospheric chemistry, biosecurity and climate change (Fiore et al., 1998; Ramanathan and Feng, 2009; IPCC, 2014). More than 90% of O3 is concentrated in the stratosphere, with the remainder concentrated in the troposphere (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). Stratospheric O3 reduces the UV radiation reaching the surface, thus acting as a protective layer for the Earth's ecosystem, and is also an important influence factor for global climate change (Bruhl and Crutzen, 1989; IPCC, 2014). High concentrations of tropospheric O3, especially O3 within near-earth, can seriously deteriorate air quality, endanger human health (causing respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, etc.) and damage crops and vegetation, and so on (Hudman et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006; Turner et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018). In addition, tropospheric O3 is a very important oxidant in the atmosphere and can participate directly or indirectly in a wide range of homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions in the atmosphere (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998; Wang et al., 2017). Therefore, O3 has received strong attention and become a key research area worldwide, especially during the recent decades when O3 pollution has become frequent due to significant anthropogenic activities (Vingarzan, 2004; Oltmans et al., 2006; Ding et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). The O3 in the stratosphere is mainly derived from the recombination of oxygen molecules with oxygen atoms which was generated by the decomposition of oxygen molecules by solar UV radiation (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). There are two main sources of O3 in the troposphere. One is secondary chemicals generated by photochemical reactions of O3 precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx, i.e., NO and NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Price et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018). The other is the leakage or transport of stratospheric O3 (McLinden et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2013). The source of O3 in the near-surface atmosphere is mainly the former in the vast majority of regions. However, this may be different in background regions, and the contents about O3 refers to the O3 in the near-surface atmosphere. For convenience, all the O3 involved afterwards represent O3 in the near-surface atmosphere. In recent decades, as the global industry and economy continue to grow, the massive combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas and human activities have generated a large number of primary and secondary pollutants, including the precursors (NOx, CO and VOCs, etc.) required for O3 generation (Wang et al., 2009b; Tang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012). Consequently, O3 generation is enhanced, especially in some regions where anthropogenic emissions are significant. In addition to the important influence of precursor emissions on O3, meteorological factors can also influence O3 levels through a complex set of processes, including emissions, transport, chemical transformation and removal effects, and O3 pollution events are often caused by a combination of high-intensity emissions and unfavorable meteorological conditions (Jenkin and Clemitshaw, 2000; Tang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2018;). The main meteorological factors affecting O3 are solar radiation, temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, humidity, and wind (Ding et al., 2004, 2013; Wang et al., 2017). O3 background concentration (O3 background) is an important element of O3 studies that helps to understand the variability of O3 (Vingarzan, 2004; Xu et al., 2008). However, there are different definitions of O3 background at present (U.S. EPA, 1996; Chan and Vet, 2010; Parrish et al. 2009; The Royal Society, 2008; Cooper et al., 2015). In this study, the O3 background refers to as the level of O3 in the atmosphere that measured at a site without the influence of strong local effects, and it is often also used to describe the baseline O3 level in the atmosphere. However, we still include some model results that completely shut down anthropogenic emissions within the research and refer to them as O3 background as well in Section 2.4. O3 background mainly includes O3 transported downward from the stratosphere to the near-earth layer, O3 from natural emissions of methane from marshes, wetland soils, etc. reacting with NOx, O3 from Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound (BVOC) reacting with natural NOx, and O3 from external transport (U.S. EPA, 1996). Therefore, O3 background is highly regional and varies seasonally. O3 concentrations in U.S. summer surface air contained a background contribution of 20\u201345 ppb (A.M. Fiore et al., 2002). Currently, studies on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns, meteorological effects and causal mechanisms of O3 are mainly concentrated on cities, focusing on the effects of human activities on urban O3 (Oltmans et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2017), while relatively little research has been conducted on O3 background. Understanding the O3 background and spatial and temporal distribution characteristics can help to resolve the effects of regional atmospheric oxidation and regional O3 transport, and also help to guide the development of O3 pollution standards and O3 pollution control. A comparison of O3 background with that measured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shows that the current O3 background has increased approximately twofold (Vingarzan, 2004; IPCC, 2014). This rise has occurred in parallel with industrial development, suggesting that the current O3 background includes a large anthropogenic contribution. To systematically capture the global O3 background, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has conducted O3 monitoring in its organized Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) network, and the results show that the global atmospheric oxidation has been increasing in recent years, leading to an average annual increase of 0.15 nmol/mol in O3 background, and an average annual increase of 0.31 nmol/mol in urban per year, with the same upward trend, but the rate of increase is lower in background areas than in cities (Sicard, 2021). Desert areas, as special ecosystems, occupy about 1/3 of the Earth's land area and have their own unique surface and climatic characteristics. However, compared to ecosystems such as grasslands, tropical rainforests and cities, there are very few studies on O3 or other atmospheric pollutants in the desert. Desert areas tend to be far from industrial and densely populated areas, so there are fewer sources of air pollution, and industrial emissions and traffic pollution have relatively little impact on O3. However, desert areas usually have intense sunlight and high radiation levels, which favor photochemical reactions that promote O3 formation. Meantime, desert areas have low VOC emissions due to low vegetation cover and weak industrial emissions, and therefore are more susceptible to NOx in the photochemical generation reaction of O3. Therefore, the study of O3 in desert context is necessary and useful as a reference for O3 transport in desert areas downwind of the region. Liu et al. (2022) showed that O3 levels in this desert region were about 45\u201355 ppb in summer and 10\u201315 ppb in winter based on 8 years of observations of atmospheric O3 in the Taklamakan Desert in western China. However, this study only covered O3 and temperature and humidity, and did not include some precursors of O3. In this study, long-term summer multisite observations of the Alxa Desert in northwest China (8500 km2, the second largest area in China and the fourth largest in the world) were conducted from 2019 to 2021, including conventional pollutant and meteorological data, to analyze the O3 characteristics according to the degree of anthropogenic influence on the sites and O3 background in the desert region. The characteristics of O3 under sand-dust weather/processes were also analyzed. In general, the related observed results can fill the gap of O3 research and knowledge in the desert area. 1 Site and data information The sites are located in the Alxa Desert region of the Alxa League and are divided into four sites according to how much they are affected by anthropogenic (Anth.) factors, which are slight, light, mild and severe. The detailed site locations are shown in Fig. 1 . Slight Anth. Effect (101.06°E, 41.95°N; altitude: 940 m) is adjacent to a national park (covering an area of 5636 hectares, and including desert, Gobi, grassland, lakes, and poplar forests) on its right side, and desert or Gobi on its left side, with a low or insignificant anthropogenic effects. Light Anth. Effect (101.67°E, 39.21°N; altitude: 1500 m) is located in a small town surrounded by desert or Gobi, with a population of about 20,000, and has a light level of anthropogenic effects. Mild Anth. Effect (105.70°E, 38.84°N; altitude: 1600 m) is located in Alxa Left Banner, with a population of about 140,000, surrounded mainly by residential living areas, and is under moderate or high anthropogenic influence. Severe Anth. Effect (106.70°E, 39.42°N; altitude: 1150 m) is located in the Alxa Economic Development Zone, which is one of the 20 provincial key development zones in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, and surrounded by industrial clusters focusing on the salt chemical industry and the coal chemical industry, with a very significant level of anthropogenic effects. All monitoring sites (including monitoring instruments and data quality control) comply with the requirements of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China and the General Environmental Monitoring Station of China for automatic monitoring of ambient air quality. The four sites are located at distances of 100 to 600 km from each other, and the observed data can represent the regional characteristics. The observations are mainly meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind) and conventional pollutant data (O3, NO2, NO, CO and PM10) for the time range of summer 2019 to 2021 with hourly temporal resolution. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Changes in pollutants and meteorological conditions Figs. 2\u20134 show the general information and changes in O3, NOx (NO2 and NO), CO and meteorological factors (temperature and relative humidity) for the four sites in summer from 2019 to 2021. The mean concentrations of O3, NO2, NO and CO during the observation period with Slight Anth. Effect were 98 ± 6 µg/m3, 9 ± 1 µg/m3, 2 ± 0.5 µg/m3 and 0.32 ± 0.01 mg/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations of each pollutant with Light Anth. Effect were 103 ± 10 µg/m3, 9 ± 1 µg/m3, 3 ± 1 µg/m3 and 0.40 ± 0.08 mg/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations of pollutants with Mild Anth. Effect were 119 ± 4 µg/m3, 8 ± 1 µg/m3, 2 ± 0.2 µg/m3 and 0.45 ± 0.05 mg/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations of each pollutant with Severe Anth. Effect were 90 ± 7 µg/m3, 26 ± 1 µg/m3, 6 ± 1 µg/m3 and 1.45 ± 0.35 mg/m3. The mean concentrations of PM2.5 (PM10) at the four sites were 25 ± 1 µg/m3 (73 ± 5 µg/m3), 26 ± 3 µg/m3 (70 ± 7 µg/m3), 20 ± 1 µg/m3 (45 ± 5 µg/m3), and 31 ± 3 µg/m3 (77 ± 6 µg/m3). There was no significant trend in O3 over the last three years except for the Mild Anth. Effect regions where summer O3 decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019, and the Severe Anth. Effect regions had a large intra-day variability in O3. The NOx concentrations in the Slight, Light, and Mild Anth. Effect regions were close, and the NOx in the heavily anthropogenic impacted region was about three times higher than the other three regions. O3 concentration is very sensitive to NOx, which will favor the photochemical production of O3 with VOCs and CO during the daytime, but will be the main O3 consumer at night. So O3 in the Severe Anth. Effect region with high NOx, CO, and VOCs emissions can reach higher hourly concentrations. Also, high NO at night had a significant titration effect on O3, which was the main oxidant of atmospheric chemistry at night. This resulted in lower O3 concentrations in the Severe Anth. Effect region at night. Therefore, the daily average O3 values in the Severe Anth. Effect region was lower compared to the other three regions. In addition, the O3 in the Light and Mild Anth. Effect regions were higher than the Slight Effect region for similar NOx concentrations, indicating the role of anthropogenic activities on O3. This was mainly because the enhanced anthropogenic impact provided precursors such as CO and VOCs that promoted O3 production. The mean values of temperature at the four sites were 26.5 ± 0.2 °C, 23.4 ± 0.3 °C, 22.7 ± 0.6 °C, and 24.0 ± 0.6 °C. And the mean values of relative humidity at the four sites were 27% ± 2%, 34% ± 2%, 38% ± 2%, and 44% ± 2%, respectively. The Slight Anth. Effect region was drier and hotter than the other three regions, and usually O3 increased gradually with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity. However, the higher temperature and drier atmospheric conditions did not result in higher O3 concentrations in this region. It was mainly limited by the low concentrations of CO and VOCs. 2.2 O3 in relation to NOx and meteorological conditions Fig. 5 a-c shows the relationship between the maximum one-hour concentration of O3 and temperature, humidity and NOx, respectively. All four sites show a trend of increasing O3 with temperature, but the speed of the increasing trend varied. The anthropogenic activities influenced the relationship of O3 with temperature. The stronger the anthropogenic influence area, the more rapidly O3 increased with temperature and can reach higher concentrations. Under the same temperature conditions, high NOx emissions were more favorable for O3 production. Except for the heavily anthropogenic zone, the O3 starting concentrations in the other three zones were in the range of 100\u2013110 µg/m3. High humidity did reduce O3 concentrations, and atmospheric water vapor affected O3 production by influencing solar UV radiation. It can be found that the sensitivity of O3 to water vapor was low when the relative humidity was less than 40 % (no significant relationship between O3 concentration and water vapor) in the whole Alxa Desert region. However, when the relative humidity was greater than or equal to 40%, O3 decreased gradually with the increase of relative humidity, hindering the production of O3. There was no doubt that O3 showed a positive correlation with NO2, but the strength of the positive relationship was equally influenced by anthropogenic activities. The trend of O3 growth with NO2 was slow in the area with Slight Anth. Effect compared to the area with anthropogenic influence. This may be due to the lower concentrations of CO and VOCs, etc. However, NO2 did not always promote the production of O3, and when NO2 increased to a certain concentration, O3 instead decreased with NO2. This NO2 concentration threshold was about 10 , 10, 10 and 30 µg/m3 at the four sites, respectively. The nighttime O3 concentration, which remains at a low level, has also been used to represent the background O3 given that photochemical reactions are negligible at night (Chan et al., 2003). Nevertheless, the effect of NO titration, which occurs at the local scale and dissipates ambient O3, causes the loss of ambient O3 during the nighttime and further influences the estimation of the O3 background concentration. O3 night total is defined and calculated as follows: (1) [ O 3 night total ] = [ O 3 ] + [ NO 2 ] − α × [ NO x ] where, [O3], [NO2], and [NOx] (= [NO] + [NO2]) are the ambient mixing ratios or mass concentration of O3, NO2, and NOx monitored at the same site, respectively; and α, which was set to 0.1 based on previous studies, is the fraction of the NO2 contained in the primary NOx emissions source (Akimoto et al., 2015; Itano et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2022). As can be seen in Fig. 5 d, the increase of NO2 at night decreased the O3. The inhibition of O3 by NO2 was especially obvious in the Severe Anth. Effect, which had a high concentration of NO2. This is mainly due to the fact that at night O3 reacted with NO2 to form NO3 radicals, which were the main oxidizing agents of atmospheric chemistry at night (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). In addition to this, it can also be found that when Severe Anth. Effect O3 decreased with increasing NO2 at night, the concentration of NO was also gradually increasing, which can further consume O3. When low concentrations of NO2, i.e., the anthropogenic influence of NOx was weaker, were considered, the concentration of O3 in the regions was around 90\u2013100 µg/m3. Moreover, the O3 night total was largely independent of humidity conditions and exhibited stable concentrations in each region, again around 90\u2013100 µg/m3, reflecting the regional background characteristics. Fig. 6 shows the intra-day hourly variation of O3 (O3 night total) and NOx. NOx also indicates to some extent the degree of regional anthropogenic influence. Except for the area of Severe Anth. Effect (NOx was about 30 µg/m3), NOx in the other three regions was around 10 µg/m3. All four regions showed NOx peaked from about 8:00 to 9:00, which may be related to motor vehicle emissions during peak hours and the transmission of the residual layer at night. The O3 night total and daytime O3 concentrations were close to each other, and they jointly reflected the summer background O3 concentrations in the four regions, which were about 110 µg/m3 (Slight Anth. Effect), 110 µg/m3 (Light Anth. Effect), 120 µg/m3 (Mild Anth. Effect) and 110 µg/m3 (Severe Anth. Effect), respectively. 2.3 O3 characteristics of sandy weather or sandstorm Since the four observation sites are located in the background of desert, which are prone to occur sand-dust weather or even dust storms. While sand and dust are mainly manifested as PM10 pollution, high PM10 concentrations will reduce the solar radiation reaching the near-earth layer and will have a significant impact on the main O3 production process, i.e., photochemical processes. In this study, the moments when the hourly PM10 concentrations were significantly higher than the contemporaneous levels during the three-year summer period and the time range of 5 h before and after were selected as the dust moments. In this way, the effect of sand and dust on O3 was investigated, and the related results are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be found that as the PM10 concentration increased, the O3 concentrations in the four regions gradually decreased and finally leveled off and stabilized around a certain range. The O3 in the Slight Anth. Effect area finally stabilized at ∼ 105 µg/m3, and this value in the other three areas were ∼ 100 µg/m3 (Light Anth. Effect), ∼ 110 µg/m3 (Mild Anth. Effect), and ∼ 90 µg/m3 (Severe Anth. Effect), respectively. The increase in PM10 did cause a large decrease in O3 concentration (∼ 40%), but it did not mean that O3 decreased indefinitely with the increase in PM10. All four regions exhibited relatively low NO2 concentrations and temperatures compared to non-sandy moments, suggesting that sand-dust processes had a cutting effect on other pollutants and temperatures, which can also contribute to some reduction in O3. For wind speed, except for the anthropogenically influenced mild regions, the wind speed during dusty moments were generally higher than that during non-dusty moments. It was noteworthy that the final stable O3 values during the dusty moments were comparable to the \"valley value\u201d of O3 during the non-dusty moments. This indicated that the O3 concentrations in the region were similar in this desert background, and that this stable O3 concentration was the local background O3 concentration, as well as the O3 concentration carried in the airflow during the dust and sand process. Except for the Severe Anth. Effect area, the maximum difference of this stable O3 value in the other three regions was less than 10 µg/m3, indicating that the basal O3 concentration in this desert background was around 100 µg/m3. 2.4 Summer O3 background concentrations in the Alxa desert compared to other areas in world According to the previous discussion, the summer O3 background in the Alxa desert region is around 100 µg/m3 (60 ppb). Compared with other regions within China, summer O3 background in Alxa are high (Table S1 and Fig. 8 ). Studies by Xiao et al. (2022) showed that the average summer O3 concentrations in 2016\u20132020 in 15 natural background areas in China which were away from anthropogenic disturbances and their adjacent urban sites were 74 and 71 µg/m3, respectively. Chen et al. (2022) reported the O3 background (model results) of 55 ± 23 ppb, 54 ± 16 ppb, 53 ± 13 ppb, 53 ± 15 ppb, and 52 ± 20 ppb from August to November in five regions of China, namely, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Fen-Wei Plain (FWP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Sichuan Basin (SCB), and Pearl River Delta (PRD), respectively. The summer O3 at the Global Atmospheric Watch Station (GAWS) in Waliguan, located on the northeastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau in China, were 55\u201360 ppb (Jin et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). The summer O3 at the Akedala station (GAWS) located in Xinjiang, Northwest China, was 40 ppb (Liu et al., 2019). O3 background at the Namucuo natural background station in Tibet was 100 µg/m3 in summer (Xiao et al., 2022). The regional summer O3 background in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was 95\u2013130 µg/m3 (50\u201370 ppb) (Yang et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2006; Yao et al., 2021). In Longfengshan station (GAWS), which was in the northeastern region of China, the summer O3 was 35 ppb (Liu et al., 2019). The summer O3 in the forest and alpine background region in eastern China was 90 µg/m3 (Su, 2013). The summer O3 in the mountainous forest background region in southwest China was lower at 28 ppb due to atmospheric circulation (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2022). The O3 in the tropical rainforest background region of Hainan, south China, was 65 µg/m3 (Xie et al., 2022). The summer O3 at the Linan station (GAWS) in eastern China, was 30\u201360 ppb (Xu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008). And the summer O3 at the background station in the PRD region of southern China was 85 µg/m3 (Shen et al., 2019). In a comprehensive comparison of O3 background values for various regions or ecosystems within China, it can be seen that Alxa desert areas had higher summer O3 background and the O3 background in the Severe Anth. Effect aera of the Alxa Desert was similar to those of the economically developed cities mentioned above, which was about 50 ppb. Northern cities seemed to have higher O3 background. Among these studies about O3 background in China, the altitudes of the study region, from high to low, are Namucuo (4718 m), Waliguan (3816 m), Xianggelila (3580 m), Wuyishan (1139 m), Hainan (1000 m), FWP (700\u2013800 m), SCB (500\u2013700 m), Akedala (562 m), Longfengshan (330 m), BTH (10\u2013100 m), PRD (50 m), YRD (10 m). Therefore, the O3 background values are not exclusively related to altitude, but are highly localized, e.g., related to the local topographic characteristics, the atmospheric circulation, and the type of surface. Besides, the O3 background values at some forest background sites (Longfengshan, Wuyishan, and Hainan) showed large differences, which may be related to BVOC emissions from different tree species and meteorological conditions. The Tibetan Plateau and its neighboring areas (including Alxa) have high O3 background values, which is related to the higher average altitude of the Tibetan Plateau. Compared with other regions in world, summer O3 background in Alxa are also at relatively high levels (Table S1 and Fig. 8). Within other Asian countries, summer O3 background were about 20\u201340 ppb in Korea (Lee and Park, 2022; Yeo and Kim, 2021), 20\u201360 ppb in Japan (Sunwoo et al., 1994; Tsutsumi et al., 1994), and 15\u201325 ppb in Malasia (Toh et al., 2013). O3 in South Korea and Japan is influenced by long-range transport from northern China (Lee et al., 2022; Yeo et al., 2021; Sunwoo et al., 1994), and the high background O3 concentrations in Japan are associated with one of the high-altitude atmospheric monitoring background stations (GAWS) located on Mt. Fuji (Tsutsumi et al., 1994). In North America, summer O3 background ranged from 30 to 55 ppb in the western United States (Chang et al., 2017; Chan and Vet, 2010; Cooper et al., 2012; Jaffe et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2009a; A. Fiore et al., 2002, A. 2003), 30\u201345 ppb in the eastern United States (Chan and Vet, 2010; Parrish et al., 2009; Jaffe and Ray, 2007; Oltmans et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2012; Jaffe et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2009a; A.M. Fiore et al., 2002, A. 2003; Parrish et al., 2021), 15\u201325 ppb in western Canada (Chan and Vet, 2010), and 20\u201325 ppb in eastern Canada (Chan and Vet, 2010). In western Europe, summer O3 background were about 20\u201340 ppb (Yan et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2012; Parrish et al., 2009; The Royal Society, 2008), but increased to about 40\u201360 ppb when moved south to the Mediterranean Sea (Cristofanelli and Bonasoni, 2009; Kalabokas et al., 2000,2007; Kourtidis, et al., 2002; Kouvarakis et al., 2000), which was related to the Mediterranean climate, topography, pressure field and the altitude of the monitoring stations. In addition to this, summer O3 background was also higher in Alxa than in eastern or southeastern Australia (Ayers et al., 1996; Riley et al., 2022, 2023) and South Africa (Swartz et al., 2020) in the southern hemisphere. Regardless, the summer background O3 concentrations in the Alxa Desert region are higher than in the natural background and urban areas in the vast majority of China and other regions in world. This may be due to the following reasons: Firstly, the Alxa Desert is located on the Inner Mongolia Plateau at an altitude of about 1000 m, with long sunshine hours and high tropospheric O3 production capacity. Secondly, this region is weakly influenced by anthropogenic influence and less substances (such as NO) to consume O3. Thirdly, the surface is relatively homogeneous in a wide range, and the regional weather is uniform and mostly sunny, with almost no rainfall, so the regional O3 is accumulated and distributed more evenly horizontally. Besides, the desert subsurface has a strong daytime convection due to its special properties (small specific heat, wide area, no shading, etc.), making the desert area a huge \u201csource of warmth\u201d, which further aggravates the rise in air temperature. Then high-altitude O3 will be accompanied by downward transmission as vertical convection intensifies. In addition, desert regions typically have a higher atmospheric stability at night, i.e., less vertical mixing within the atmosphere. This may lead to the accumulation of O3 in the lower atmosphere, resulting in relatively high background O3 concentrations. In addition, desert heat waves (persistent hot weather phenomena) occur frequently in summer, which are usually caused by the control of warm high-pressure ridges (Chen et al., 2023). In areas controlled by warm ridges, subsiding air is prevalent, which on the one hand compresses and warms the air as it sinks, and on the other hand the upward movement is weak, with few clouds and little rain. Such downdrafts may also carry high-altitude O3 down to the surface and constrain the O3 to the stable near-surface atmosphere. 3 Conclusions High summer background O3 (100 µg/m3 or 60 ppb) was found in a highland desert, which is an unexcepted finding and a relatively high level worldwide. In terms of O3 production conditions, the abundant solar radiation, dry atmosphere, unique geographical location, vast homogeneous and low specific heat surface, etc., in desert areas provide favorable environment for O3 production. On the other hand, in terms of O3 depletion conditions, low anthropogenic influences and weak O3 depletion during night pulled up the O3 baseline. In addition to these, strong daytime convection of atmosphere due to higher altitudes and unique surface features may also contribute to the downward transport and convergence of O3 in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, the average summer O3 in the Alxa Desert region is high and has a flat daily variation. However, anthropogenic influences can still significantly affect regional O3 levels. In the heavily anthropogenic influenced areas, the daily variation of O3 also shows the same characteristics of urban O3 daily variation. Similar to urban areas, high temperature and low humidity conditions favor O3 production. The increase of NO2 also promotes O3 production, but starts to suppress O3 after a certain threshold. The sand-dust process has a reducing effect on O3 concentration, but with the increase of PM10, O3 will gradually stabilize at a certain concentration, i.e., the O3 background value. Overall, O3 in the unique ecosystem of the desert exhibits different characteristics from other ecosystems, but is still driven by the same O3 NOx-VOCs-CO chemical mechanism.

        "dc:description": "Generally speaking, the precursors of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are very low in desert areas due to the lack of anthropogenic emissions and natural emissions, and thus O3 concentrations are relatively low. However, high summer background concentrations of about 100 µg/m3 or 60 ppb were found in the Alxa Desert in the highland of northwest China based on continuous summer observations from 2019 to 2021, which was higher than the most of natural background areas or clean areas in world for summer O3 background concentrations. The high O3 background concentrations were related to surface features and altitude. Heavy-intensity anthropogenic activity areas in desert areas can cause increased O3 concentrations or pollution, but also generated O3 depleting substances such as nitrous oxide, which eventually reduced the regional O3 baseline values. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) also had a dual effect on O3 generation, showing promotion at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. In addition, sand-dust weather reduced O3 clearly, but O3 eventually stabilized around the background concentration values and did not vary with sand-dust particulate matter.",
